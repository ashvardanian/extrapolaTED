{"topic": "The Future of French Architecture", "articles": ["Architecture of Paris\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nThe city of Paris has notable examples of architecture of every period, from the Middle Ages to the 21st century. It was the birthplace of the Gothic style, and has important monuments of the French Renaissance, Classical revival, the Flamboyant style of the reign of Napoleon III, the Belle \u00c9poque, and the Art Nouveau style. The great Exposition Universelle (1889) and 1900 added Paris landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower and Grand Palais. In the 20th century, the Art Deco style of architecture first appeared in Paris, and Paris architects also influenced the postmodern architecture of the second half of the century.\n\nThe Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (990\u20131160)\nThe Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (990\u20131160)\n\n \nCathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris (1160\u20131230)\nCathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris (1160\u20131230)\n\n \nRenaissance wing of the Louvre (1546), by Pierre Lescot\nRenaissance wing of the Louvre (1546), by Pierre Lescot\n\n \nDome of Les Invalides (1677\u20131706) by Jules Hardouin-Mansart\nDome of Les Invalides (1677\u20131706) by Jules Hardouin-Mansart\n\n \nThe \u00c9cole Militaire (1751\u20131780) by Ange-Jacques Gabriel\nThe \u00c9cole Militaire (1751\u20131780) by Ange-Jacques Gabriel\n\n \nThe Arc de Triomphe (1806\u20131836) by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin\nThe Arc de Triomphe (1806\u20131836) by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin\n\n \nPalais Garnier (1861\u20131875) by Charles Garnier\nPalais Garnier (1861\u20131875) by Charles Garnier\n\n \nThe Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur (1874\u20131916) by Paul Abadie\nThe Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur (1874\u20131916) by Paul Abadie\n\n \nThe Grand Palais (1897\u20131900), by Henri Deglane, Charles Girault, Albert Louvet and Albert Thomas\nThe Grand Palais (1897\u20131900), by Henri Deglane, Charles Girault, Albert Louvet and Albert Thomas\n\n\nContents\n1\tGallo-Roman architecture\n2\tRomanesque churches\n3\tThe Middle Ages\n3.1\tThe Palais de la Cit\u00e9\n3.2\tCity walls and castles\n3.3\tChurches \u2013 the birth of the Gothic Style\n3.4\tHouses and manors\n4\tRenaissance Paris (16th century)\n4.1\tReligious architecture\n4.2\tHouses and h\u00f4tels particuliers\n5\tThe 17th century \u2013 The Baroque, the dome, and the debut of Classicism\n5.1\tRoyal squares and urban planning\n5.2\tPalaces and monuments\n5.3\tReligious architecture\n5.4\tDebut of the dome\n5.5\tResidential architecture \u2013 the rustic style\n5.6\tResidences \u2013 the classical style\n6\tThe 18th century \u2013 The triumph of neoclassicism\n6.1\tReligious architecture\n6.2\tR\u00e9gence and Louis XV residential architecture\n6.3\tUrbanism \u2013 the Place de la Concorde\n6.4\tUrbanism under Louis XVI\n6.5\tParis architecture on the eve of the Revolution\n7\tRevolutionary Paris\n8\tThe Paris of Napoleon (1800\u20131815)\n8.1\tMonuments\n8.2\tThe Egyptian style\n8.3\tThe debut of iron architecture\n9\tThe Restoration (1815\u20131830)\n9.1\tPublic buildings and monuments\n9.2\tReligious architecture\n9.3\tCommercial architecture \u2013 the shopping gallery\n9.4\tResidential architecture\n10\tThe Paris of Louis-Philippe (1830\u20131848)\n10.1\tMonuments and public squares\n10.2\tPreservation and restoration\n10.3\tThe Beaux-Arts style\n10.4\tThe first train stations\n11\tNapoleon III and the Second Empire style (1848\u20131870)\n11.1\tReligious architecture - the Neo-Gothic and eclectic styles\n11.2\tRailway stations and commercial architecture\n12\tThe Belle \u00c9poque (1871\u20131913)\n12.1\tThe Great Expositions\n12.2\tReligious architecture\n12.3\tThe department store and the office building\n12.4\tRailroad stations\n12.5\tResidential architecture \u2013 Beaux-Arts to Art Nouveau\n13\tBetween the wars - Art Deco and modernism (1919\u20131939)\n13.1\tArt Deco\n13.2\tExposition architecture\n13.3\tResidential architecture\n13.4\tPublic housing\n13.5\tReligious architecture\n14\tAfter World War II (1946\u20132000)\n14.1\tThe triumph of modernism\n14.2\tPresidential projects\n14.3\tThe age of towers\n14.4\tPublic housing \u2013 the HLM and the barre\n15\tContemporary (2001\u2013present )\n15.1\tSupermodernism\n15.2\tEcological architecture\n15.3\tConversions\n15.4\tPublic housing\n16\tSee also\n17\tReferences\n17.1\tNotes and citations\n17.2\tBooks cited in the text\n18\tExternal links\nGallo-Roman architecture\nThe Ar\u00e8nes de Lut\u00e8ce, the open-air amphitheater of Lutece (1st century AD)\nThe Ar\u00e8nes de Lut\u00e8ce, the open-air amphitheater of Lutece (1st century AD)\n\n \nModel of the Roman forum of Lutetia (Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet)\nModel of the Roman forum of Lutetia (Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet)\n\n \nThe Thermes de Cluny or Roman baths (2nd or 3rd century AD)\nThe Thermes de Cluny or Roman baths (2nd or 3rd century AD)\n\n \nRemains of a Roman wall beneath the square in front of Notre-Dame de Paris\nRemains of a Roman wall beneath the square in front of Notre-Dame de Paris\n\n \nAncient Roman column re-used in the nave of the Church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre\nAncient Roman column re-used in the nave of the Church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre\n\nVery little architecture remains from the ancient town of Lutetia, founded by a Celtic tribe known as the Parisii in about the 3rd century BC. It was conquered by the Romans in 52 BC, and turned into a Gallo-Roman garrison town. It was rebuilt in the 1st century AD on the classic Roman plan; a north\u2013south axis, or cardo (now rue Saint-Jacques); and an east\u2013west axis, or decumanus, of which traces have been found on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, at rue de Lut\u00e8ce. The center of Roman administration was on the island; the Roman governor's palace stood where the Palais de Justice is located today. The right bank was largely undeveloped. The city grew up the Left Bank, on the slopes of Mount Saint-Genevi\u00e8ve. The Roman forum was on the summit of the hill, under the present Rue Soufflot, between the boulevard Saint-Michel and rue Saint-Jacques.[1]\n\nThe Roman town had three large baths near the forum, supplied with water by a 46-kilometer-long aqueduct. Vestiges of one bath, the Thermes de Cluny, can still be seen on Boulevard Saint-Michel. It was the largest of the three baths, one hundred meters by sixty-five meters, and was built at the end of the 2nd century or beginning of the 3rd century BC, at the height of the town's grandeur. The baths are now part of the Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge, or National Museum of the Middle Ages. Nearby, on rue Monge, are the vestiges of the Roman amphitheater, called the Ar\u00e8nes de Lut\u00e8ce, which was discovered and restored in the 19th century. Though the population of the town was probably no more than 5\u20136 thousand persons, the amphitheater measured 130 meters by 100 meters, and could seat fifteen thousand persons. Fifteen tiers of seats remain from the original thirty-five. It was built in the 1st century AD and was used for the combat of gladiators and animals, and also for theatrical performances.[1]\n\nAnother notable piece of Gallo-Roman architecture was discovered under the choir of Notre-Dame de Paris; the Pillar of the Boatmen, a fragment of a Roman column with carvings of both Roman and Gallic gods. It was probably made at the beginning of the 1st century during the reign of the Emperor Tiberius to honor the league of the boatmen, who played an important part in the town's economy and religious and civic life. It is now on display in the Roman baths at the Museum of the Middle Ages. Other fragments of Gallo-Roman architecture are found in the crypt under the square in front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame; and in the Church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, where several Roman columns, probably from a temple, were re-used in the late 12th century to build a Christian church.[2]\n\nRomanesque churches\nRomanesque bell tower of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (990\u20131160)\nRomanesque bell tower of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (990\u20131160)\n\n \nThe Chapel of Saint Symphorien (11th century), the earliest chapel in the church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\nThe Chapel of Saint Symphorien (11th century), the earliest chapel in the church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s\n\n \nInterior of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre (1147\u20131200)\nInterior of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre (1147\u20131200)\n\n \nInterior of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre (1170\u20131220)\nInterior of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre (1170\u20131220)\n\n \nThe former church of Saint-Martin-des-Champs (1060\u20131140) is now part of the Mus\u00e9e des arts et m\u00e9tiers\nThe former church of Saint-Martin-des-Champs (1060\u20131140) is now part of the Mus\u00e9e des arts et m\u00e9tiers\n\nUnlike the Southern France, Paris has very few examples of Romanesque architecture; most churches and other buildings in that style were rebuilt in the Gothic style. The most remarkable example of Romanesque architecture in Paris is the church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, built between 990 and 1160 during the reign of Robert the Pious. An earlier church had been destroyed by the Vikings in the 9th century. The oldest elements of the original church existing today are the tower (the belfry at the top was added in the 12th century), and the chapel of Saint Symphorien, on the south flank of the bell tower, built in the 11th century. It is considered the earliest existing place of worship in Paris. The gothic choir, with its flying buttresses, was added in the mid-12th century, it was consecrated by Pope Alexander III, in 1163. It was one of the earliest Gothic style elements to appear in a Paris church.[3]\n\nRomanesque and Gothic elements are found together in several old Paris churches. The church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre (1147\u20131200) is the only surviving building of the vast Abbey of Montmartre, which once covered the top of the hill; it has both ancient Roman columns and one of the first examples of a Gothic arched ceiling, in the nave near the choir. The interior of the church of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre (1170\u20131220) has been extensively rebuilt, but it still has massive Romanesque columns and the exterior is a classic example of the Romano-Gothic style. The former priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs (1060\u20131140) has a choir and chapels supported by contreforts and a Romanesque bell tower. It now belongs to the Musee des Arts et Metiers.[4]\n\nThe Middle Ages\nThe Palais de la Cit\u00e9 as it appeared between 1412 and 1416, as illustrated in the Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry\nThe Palais de la Cit\u00e9 as it appeared between 1412 and 1416, as illustrated in the Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry\n\n \nUpper chapel of Sainte-Chapelle (1242\u201348)\nUpper chapel of Sainte-Chapelle (1242\u201348)\n\n \nCeiling of the lower chapel of Sainte-Chapelle (1242\u201348)\nCeiling of the lower chapel of Sainte-Chapelle (1242\u201348)\n\n \nThe Conciergerie; the Hall of the Men-at-Arms (early 14th century)\nThe Conciergerie; the Hall of the Men-at-Arms (early 14th century)\n\n \nThe original towers of the Palais de la Cit\u00e9; the Tour Bonbec (1226\u201370), far right, is the oldest; the Cesar Tower and Silver Tower (center) and Horloge Tower (left) were built in the 14th century.\nThe original towers of the Palais de la Cit\u00e9; the Tour Bonbec (1226\u201370), far right, is the oldest; the Cesar Tower and Silver Tower (center) and Horloge Tower (left) were built in the 14th century.\n\n \nThe first clock was installed on the tower of the Horloge in 1370.

The current clock is modern.\n\nThe Palais de la Cit\u00e9\nIn 987 Hugues Capet became the first King of France, and established his capital in Paris, though at the time his kingdom was little bigger than the \u00cele-de-France, or modern Paris region. The first royal residence, the Palais de la Cit\u00e9, was established within the fortress at the western end of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, where the Roman governors had established their residence. Capet and his successors gradually enlarged their kingdom through marriages and conquests. His son, Robert the Pious (972\u20131031), built the first palace, the Palais de la Cit\u00e9, and royal chapel within the walls of the fortress, and his successors embellished it over the centuries; by the reign of Philippe le Bel in the 14th century, it was the most magnificent palace in Europe. The tallest structure was the Grosse Tour, or great tower, built by Louis le Gros between 1080 and 1137. It had a diameter of 11.7 meters at the base and walls three meters thick, and remained until its demolition in 1776. The ensemble of buildings (seen in the image at right as they were between 1412 and 1416) included a royal residence, a great hall for ceremonies, and four large towers along the Seine on the north side of the island, as well as a gallery of luxury shops, the first Paris shopping center. Between 1242 and 1248 King Louis IX, later known as Saint Louis, built an exquisite Gothic chapel, Sainte-Chapelle, to house the relics of the Passion of Christ which he had acquired from the Emperor of Byzantium.[5]\n\nIn 1358, a rebellion of the Parisian merchants against the royal authority, led by \u00c9tienne Marcel, caused the King, Charles V, to move his residence to a new palace, the H\u00f4tel Saint-Pol, near the Bastille at the eastern edge of the city. The Palace was used occasionally for special ceremonies and to welcome foreign monarchs, but housed the administrative offices and courts of the Kingdom, as well as an important prison. The Great Hall was destroyed by a fire in 1618, rebuilt; another fire in 1776 destroyed the residence of the King, the tower of Montgomery. During the French Revolution, the revolutionary tribunal was housed in the building; hundreds of persons, including Queen Marie Antoinette, were tried and imprisoned there, before being taken to the guillotine. After the Revolution the Conciergerie served as a prison and courthouse. It was burned by the Paris Commune in 1871, but was rebuilt. The prison was closed in 1934, and the Conciergerie became a museum.[6]\n\nSeveral vestiges of the medieval Palais de la Cit\u00e9, extensively modified and restored, can still be seen today; the royal chapel, Sainte-Chapelle; the Hall of the Men-at-Arms, (early 14th century), the former dining hall of the palace officials and guards, located underneath the now-vanished Great Hall; and the four towers along the Seine facing the right bank. The fa\u00e7ade was built in the 19th century. The tower on the far right, the Tour Bonbec, is the oldest, built between 1226 and 1270 during the reign of Louis IX, or Saint Louis. It is distinguished by the crenelation at the top of the tower. It originally was a story shorter than the other towers, but was raised to match their height in the renovation of the 19th century. The tower served as the primary torture chamber during the Middle Ages. The two towers in the center, the Tour de C\u00e9sar and the Tour d'Argent, were built in the 14th century, during the reign of Philippe le Bel. The tallest tower, the Tour de l'Horloge, was constructed by Jean le Bon in 1350, and modified several times over the centuries. The first public clock in Paris, was added by Charles V in 1370. The sculptural decoration around the clock, featuring allegorical figures of The Law and Justice, was added in 1585 century by Henry III.[7]\n\nCity walls and castles\nA vestige of the wall of Philippe Auguste, in the Le Marais quarter (1190\u20131202)\nA vestige of the wall of Philippe Auguste, in the Le Marais quarter (1190\u20131202)\n\n \nThe Bastille.

Between 1190 and 1202, King Philippe-Auguste began construction of a wall five kilometers long to protect the city on the right bank. The wall was reinforced by seventy-seven circular towers, each no more than six meters in diameter. He also began construction of a large castle, the Louvre, where the wall met the river. The Louvre was protected by a moat and a wall with ten towers. In the center was a massive circular donjon or tower, thirty meters high and fifteen meters in diameter. It was not then the residence of the King, but Philippe Auguste placed the royal archives there. Another walled complex of buildings, the Temple, the headquarters of the Knights Templar, was located on the right bank, centered around a massive tower.[7]\n\nThe city on the right bank continued to grow outwards. The Provost of the Merchants, \u00c9tienne Marcel, began building a new city wall in 1356, which doubled the area of the city. The Louvre, now surrounded by the city, was given rich decoration and a grand new stairway, and gradually became more of residence than a fortress. Charles V, in 1364\u201380, moved his primary residence from the City Palace to the H\u00f4tel Saint-Pol, a comfortable new palace in the new Le Marais quarter. To protect his new palace and the eastern flank of the city, in 1370 Charles began building the Bastille, a fortress with six cylindrical towers. At the same time, further east, in the forest of Vincennes, Charles V built an even larger castle, the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes, dominated by another massive keep or tower fifty-two meters high. It was completed in 1369. Beginning in 1379, close to the Ch\u00e2teau, he began constructing a replica of Sainte-Chapelle. Unlike the Sainte-Chapelle in the city, the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle of Vincennes was not divided into two levels; the interior was a single space, flooded with light.[8]\n\nChurches \u2013 the birth of the Gothic Style\nThe choir of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (completed 1144), the birthplace of the Gothic style\nThe choir of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (completed 1144), the birthplace of the Gothic style\n\n \nThe later eastern portion of Notre-Dame de Paris, with its spire and flying buttresses (1160\u20131330)\nThe later eastern portion of Notre-Dame de Paris, with its spire and flying buttresses (1160\u20131330)\n\n \nThe upper level of Sainte-Chapelle, the summit of Rayonnant Gothic (1250)\nThe upper level of Sainte-Chapelle, the summit of Rayonnant Gothic (1250)\n\n \nThe church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais (about 1490)\nThe church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais (about 1490)\n\n \nThe Tour Saint-Jacques a surviving example of Flamboyant Gothic (1509\u201322)\nThe Tour Saint-Jacques a surviving example of Flamboyant Gothic (1509\u201322)\n\nThe style of Gothic architecture was born in the rebuilding of the chevet of the Basilica of Saint-Denis, just outside Paris, finished in 1144. Twenty years later, the style was used on a much larger scale by Maurice de Sully in the construction of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. The construction continued until the 14th century, beginning with the twin towers on the west toward the choir in the east. The style evolved as the construction continued; the opening of the rose window on the western fa\u00e7ade were relatively narrow; the great rose windows of the central transept were much more delicate, and allowed in much more light. At the western end, the walls were supported by buttresses built directly against the walls; in the center, completed later, the walls were supported by two steps of flying buttresses. In the last century of construction, the buttresses were able to cross the same distance with a single stone arch. The towers on the west were more stately and solemn, in the classic Gothic style, while the eastern elements of the cathedral, with its combination of rose windows, spires, buttresses and pinnacles, belonged to more elaborate and decorative style, called the Gothic rayonnant.[8]\n\nOther Paris churches soon adapted the Gothic style; the choir of Abbey church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s was completely rebuilt in the new style, with pointed arches and flying buttresses. The church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre was rebuilt with ogives, or Gothic pointed arches. The church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerois, next to the Louvre, was given a portal inspired by Notre Dame, and the Church of Saint-S\u00e9verin was given a Gothic nave with the first triforium, or first-story side gallery, in Paris. The supreme example of the new style was the upper chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, where the walls seemed to be made entirely of stained glass.[8]\n\nThe Gothic Style went through another phase between 1400 and about 1550; the Flamboyant Gothic, which combined extremely refined forms and rich decoration. The style was used not only in churches, but also in some noble residences. Notable existing examples are the Church of Saint-S\u00e9verin (1489\u201395) with its famous twisting pillar; the elegant choir of the church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais; the Tour Saint-Jacques, the flamboyant Gothic vestige of an abbey church destroyed during the Revolution; and the chapel of the residence of the Abbots of Cluny, now the Museum of the Middle Ages, and the ceiling of the Tour Saint-Jean-Sans-Peur, a vestige of the former residence of the Dukes of Burgundy, in the 2nd arrondissement.\n\nHouses and manors\nThe house of Nicolas Flamel (1407), considered the oldest house in Paris, was actually a kind of hostel.\nThe house of Nicolas Flamel (1407), considered the oldest house in Paris, was actually a kind of hostel.\n\n \nThe Tour Jean-sans-Peur (1409\u201311) was part of the residence of the Dukes of Burgundy\nThe Tour Jean-sans-Peur (1409\u201311) was part of the residence of the Dukes of Burgundy\n\n \nFlamboyant gothic vaulted ceiling from the tower of Jean-Sans-Peur (1409\u201311)\nFlamboyant gothic vaulted ceiling from the tower of Jean-Sans-Peur (1409\u201311)\n\n \nThe H\u00f4tel de Sens, residence of the Archbishop of Sens (1498)\nThe H\u00f4tel de Sens, residence of the Archbishop of Sens (1498)\n\n \nCourtyard of the H\u00f4tel de Cluny, with its stairway in an exterior tower in the center (about 1500)\nCourtyard of the H\u00f4tel de Cluny, with its stairway in an exterior tower in the center (about 1500)\n\n \nFlamboyant gothic vaulted ceiling from the chapel of the H\u00f4tel de Cluny (about 1500)\nFlamboyant gothic vaulted ceiling from the chapel of the H\u00f4tel de Cluny (about 1500)\n\nThe houses in Paris during the Middle Ages were tall and narrow; usually four or five stories. They were constructed of wooden beams on a stone foundation, with the walls covered by white plaster, to prevent fires. There was usually a shop located on the ground floor. Houses built of stone reserved for the wealthy; the oldest house in the Paris is considered to be the Maison de Nicolas Flamel, at 51 rue Montmorency in the 3rd arrondissement, built in 1407. it was not a private residence, but a kind of hostel. Two houses with exposed beams at 13-15 rue Fran\u00e7ois-Miron in the 4th arrondissement, often described as Medieval, were actually built in the 16th and 17th centuries.[9]\n\nWhile there are no ordinary houses from the Middle Ages, there are several examples of manors built for the nobility and the high clergy. The Tour Jean-sans-Peur, at 20 rue \u00c9tienne-Marcel in the 2nd arrondissement, built in 1409\u201311, was part of the H\u00f4tel de Burgogne, the Paris residence of the Dukes of Burgundy. Built by Robert de Helbuterne, it contains a stairway with a magnificent flamboyant gothic ceiling. The H\u00f4tel de Cluny residence of the abbots of the Cluny Monastery, now the Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge or National Museum of the Middle Ages (1490\u20131500), has a typical feature of manors of the period; a stairway in a tower on the exterior of the building, in the courtyard. It also contains a chapel with a spectacular flamboyant Gothic ceiling. The H\u00f4tel de Sens was the Paris residence of the Archbishop of Sens, who had authority over the Bishops of Paris. It also featured a separate stairway tower in the courtyard.[9]\n\nRenaissance Paris (16th century)\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Madrid, built 1528\u201352, demolished in the 18th century\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Madrid, built 1528\u201352, demolished in the 18th century\n\n \n17th-century engraving of the Hotel de Ville, built 1533\u20131628, burned 1871, restored 1882.\n17th-century engraving of the Hotel de Ville, built 1533\u20131628, burned 1871, restored 1882.\n\n \nThe Lescot wing of the Louvre, rebuilt by Fran\u00e7ois I beginning in 1546 in the new French Renaissance style.\nThe Lescot wing of the Louvre, rebuilt by Fran\u00e7ois I beginning in 1546 in the new French Renaissance style.\n\n \nThe Fontaine des Innocents (1549), next to the city market, celebrated the official entrance of king Henry II into Paris, by Pierre Lescot and Jean Goujon.\nThe Fontaine des Innocents (1549), next to the city market, celebrated the official entrance of king Henry II into Paris, by Pierre Lescot and Jean Goujon.\n\n \nCeiling of the stairway of Henri II in the Louvre (1546\u201353), by Pierre Lescot\nCeiling of the stairway of Henri II in the Louvre (1546\u201353), by Pierre Lescot\n\n \nProject for enlargement of the Tuileries Palace (1578\u201379)\nProject for enlargement of the Tuileries Palace (1578\u201379)\n\nThe Italian Wars conducted by Charles VIII and Louis XII, at the end of the 15th and early 16th century were not very successful from a military point of view, had a direct and beneficial effect on the architecture of Paris. The two Kings returned to France with ideas for magnificent public architecture in the new Italian Renaissance style, and brought Italian architects to build them. A new manual of classical Roman architecture by the Italian Serlio also had a major effect on the new look of French buildings. A distinctly French Renaissance style, lavishly using cut stone and lavish ornamental sculpture, developed under Henry II after 1539.[10]\n\nThe first structure in Paris in the new style was the old Pont Notre-Dame (1507\u201312), designed by the Italian architect Fra Giocondo. It was lined with 68 artfully designed houses, the first example of Renaissance urbanism. King Francis I commissioned the next project; a new H\u00f4tel de Ville, or city hall, for the city. It was designed by another Italian, Domenico da Cortona, and begun in 1532 but not finished until 1628. The building was burned in 1871 by the Paris Commune, but the central portion was faithfully reconstructed in 1882. A monumental fountain in the Italian style, the Fontaine des Innocents, was built in 1549 as a tribune for the welcome of the new King, Henry II, to the city on June 16, 1549. It was designed by Pierre Lescot with sculpture by Jean Goujon, and is the oldest existing fountain in Paris.[11]\n\nThe first Renaissance Palace built in Paris was the Ch\u00e2teau de Madrid; it was a large hunting lodge designed by Philibert Delorme and erected between 1528 and 1552 west of the city in what is now the Bois de Boulogne. It was combination of both French and Italian Renaissance styles, with a high French-style roof and Italian loggias. It was demolished beginning in 1787, but a fragment can still be seen today in the Trocadero Gardens in the 16th arrondissement.\n\nUnder Henry II and his successors, the Louvre was gradually transformed from a medieval fortress into a Renaissance palace. The architect Pierre Lescot and sculptor Jean Gouchon made the Lescot wing of the Louvre, a masterpiece of combined French and Italian Renaissance art and architecture, on the southeast side of the Cour Carr\u00e9e of the Louvre (1546\u201353). Inside the Louvre, they made the staircase of Henry II (1546\u201353) and the Salle des Caryatides (1550). Both French and Italian elements were combined; the antique orders and paired columns of the Italian renaissance were combined with sculpted medallions and high roofs broken by windows (later known as the Mansard roof), which were characteristic of the French style.[12]\n\nAfter the accidental death of Henry II of France in 1559, his widow Catherine de' Medici (1519\u20131589) planned a new palace. She sold the medieval H\u00f4tel des Tournelles, where her husband had died, and began building the Tuileries Palace in using architect Philibert de l'Orme. During the reign of Henry IV (1589\u20131610), the building was enlarged to the south, so it joined the long riverside gallery, the Grande Galerie, which ran all the way to the older Louvre Palace in the east.[11]\n\nReligious architecture\nIInterior of Saint-Merri (1520\u201352)\nIInterior of Saint-Merri (1520\u201352)\n\n \nSaint-Eustache (1532\u20131640), a gothic church overlaid with Renaissance ornament\nSaint-Eustache (1532\u20131640), a gothic church overlaid with Renaissance ornament\n\n \nInterior of Saint-Eustache\nInterior of Saint-Eustache\n\n \nThe rood screen in the interior Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont (1510\u201386)\nThe rood screen in the interior Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont (1510\u201386)\n\nMost of the churches built in Paris in the 16th century are in the traditional Flamboyant style, though some have features borrowed from the Italian Renaissance. The most important Paris church of the Renaissance is Saint-Eustache, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide and 35 meters high, which in size and grandeur, approaches that of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. King Francis I wanted a monument as the centrepiece for the neighborhood of Les Halles, where the main city market was located. The church was designed by the King's favorite architect, Domenico da Cortona. The project was begun in 1519, and construction began in 1532. The pillars were inspired by the monastery church of Cluny, and the soaring interior is taken from the gothic cathedrals of the 13th century, but Cortona added details and ornament taken from the Italian Renaissance. It was not completed until 1640.[11]\n\nThe other churches of the period follow the more traditional flamboyant Gothic models. They include Saint-Merri (1520\u201352), with a plan similar to Notre-Dame; Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, which features impressive flying buttresses; and the \u00c9glise Saint-Medard. whose choir was built in beginning in 1550; St-Gervais-et-St-Protais features a soaring gothic vault in the apse, but also had a transept a more sober classical style inspired by the Renaissance. (The baroque fa\u00e7ade was added in the 17th century).in the Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont (1510\u201386), near the modern Pantheon on Mont Sainte-Genevieve, has the only remaining Renaissance rood screen (1530\u201335), a magnificent bridge across the center of the church. The flamboyant gothic church of Saint-Nicholas-des-Champs (1559) has a striking Renaissance feature; a portal on right side inspired by designs of Philibert Delorme for the former royal residence, the Palace of Tournelles in the Marais.[13]\n\nHouses and h\u00f4tels particuliers\nHouses at 13-15 rue Francois-Miron, 4th arrondissement (16th\u201317th centuries)\nHouses at 13-15 rue Francois-Miron, 4th arrondissement (16th\u201317th centuries)\n\n \nFacade of the Carnavalet Museum (1547\u201348), with sculpture by Jean Goujon\nFacade of the Carnavalet Museum (1547\u201348), with sculpture by Jean Goujon\n\n \nThe H\u00f4tel d'Angoul\u00eame Lamoignon, at 24 rue Pav\u00e9e in the Marais.

(1585\u201389), now the library of the history of Paris\n\nThe ordinary Paris house of the Renaissance was little changed from the medieval house; they were four to five stories high, narrow, built on a stone foundation of wood covered with plaster. They usually had a \"pigeon\", or gabled roof. The two houses at 13\u201315 rue Fran\u00e7ois Miron (actually built in the 16th or 17th century, but often described as medieval houses) are good examples of the Renaissance house.[9]\n\nOnce the French court returned to Paris from the Loire Valley, the nobility and wealthy merchants began to build h\u00f4tels particuliers, or large private residences, mostly in the Marais. They were built of stone and richly decorated with sculpture. They were usually built around a courtyard, and separated from the street. The residence was a located between the courtyard and garden. The fa\u00e7ade facing the courtyard had the most sculptural decoration; the fa\u00e7ade facing the garden was usually rough stone. The H\u00f4tel Carnavalet at 23 rue de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, (1547\u201349), designed by Pierre Lescot, and decorated with sculpture by Jean Goujon, is the best example of a Renaissance h\u00f4tel. As the century advanced, the exterior stairways disappeared and the fa\u00e7ades became more classical and regular. A good example of the later style is the H\u00f4tel d'Angoul\u00eame Lamoignon, at 24 rue Pav\u00e9e in the 3rd arrondissement (1585\u201389), designed by Thibaut M\u00e9tezeau.[14]\n\nThe 17th century \u2013 The Baroque, the dome, and the debut of Classicism\nThe architectural style of the French Renaissance continued to dominate in Paris through the Regency of Marie de' Medici. The end of the wars of religion allowed the continuation of several building projects, such as the expansion of the Louvre, begun in the 16th century but abandoned because of the war. With the arrival in power Louis XIII and the ministers Richelieu and Mazarin, a new architectural style, the Baroque, imported from Italy, began to appear in Paris. Its purpose, like Baroque music and painting, was to awe Parisians with its majesty and ornament, in opposition to the austere style of the Protestant Reformation. The new style in Paris was characterized by opulence, irregularity, and an abundance of decoration. The straight geometric lines of the buildings were covered with curved or triangular frontons, niches with statues or caryatids, cartouches, garlands of drapery, and cascades of fruit carved from stone.\n\nLouis XIV distrusted the unruly Parisians and spent as little time as possible in Paris, finally moving his Court to Versailles, but at the same time he wanted to transform Paris into \"The New Rome\", a city worthy of the Sun King. Over the course of his long reign, from 1643 until 1715, the architectural style in Paris gradually changed from the exuberance of the Baroque to a more solemn and formal classicism, the embodiment in stone of the King's vision of Paris as \"the new Rome.\" The new Acad\u00e9mie royale d'architecture, founded in 1671, imposed an official style, as the Academies of art and literature had earlier done. The style was modified again beginning in about 1690, as the government began to run short of money; new projects were less grandiose.[15]\n\nRoyal squares and urban planning\nResidential Squares\nThe Place Royale (now Place des Vosges) in 1612\nPlace Dauphine and the newly finished Pont Neuf in 1615\n\n \nPlace des Victoires (1684\u201397) by Jules Hardouin-Mansart\nThe Place Royale (now Place des Vosges) in 1612\n\n \nPlace Vend\u00f4me (1699\u20131702), by Jules Hardouin-Mansart\nPlace des Victoires (1684\u201397) by Jules Hardouin-Mansart\n\n \nPlace Vend\u00f4me (1699\u20131702), by Jules Hardouin-Mansart\nPlace Vend\u00f4me (1699\u20131702), by Jules Hardouin-Mansart\n\nIn the 17th century, the first large-scale urban planning of Paris was initiated by royal ordinance, largely based on the model of Italian cities, including the construction of the first residential squares. The first two squares, Place Royale (now Place des Vosges, 1605\u201312) and Place Dauphine, the latter in place of the old royal garden on the \u00cele-de-la-Cit\u00e9, were both begun by Henry IV, who also completed the first Paris bridge without houses, the Pont Neuf (1599\u20131604). The Place Royale had nine large residences on each of its four sides, with identical fa\u00e7ades. The Place Dauphine had forty houses on its three sides (of which just two remain today). Louis XIV continued the style with Place des Victoires (1684\u201397) and Place Vend\u00f4me (1699\u20131702). Both of these squares were (1) designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, (2) had statues of the King in the center, and (3) were financed largely by the sale of the houses around the squares. The residences around the latter two squares had identical classical fa\u00e7ades and were built of stone, following Hardouin-Mansart's Grand Style used in his monumental buildings. The residential squares all had pedestrian arcades on the ground floors, and what became known as a mansart window breaking the line of the high roof. They set a model for European squares in the 18th century.[16]\n\nUrban planning was another important legacy of the 17th century. In 1667 formal height limits were imposed on Paris buildings; 48 pieds (15.6 metres (51 ft)) for wooden buildings and 50 to 60 pieds (16.25 to 19.50 metres (53.3 to 64.0 ft)) for buildings of stone, following earlier rules set in place in 1607. To prevent fires, the traditional gabled roof was banned. Beginning in 1669, under the new regulations, large blocks of houses of uniform height and uniform fa\u00e7ades were built along several Paris streets on the right bank, notably rue de la Ferronnerie (1st arr.), rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 (1st arr.), rue du Mail (2nd arr.), and rue Saint-Louis-en-\u00cele on the \u00cele Saint-Louis. They usually were built of stone and composed of an arched arcade on the ground floor with two to four stories above, the windows separated by decorative columns, and a high roof broken by rows of windows. This was the birth of the iconic Paris street architecture that dominated for the next two centuries.[17]\n\nAnother element of the new architecture of Paris was the bridge. The Pont Neuf (1599\u20131604) and Pont Royal (1685\u201389), by engineer Fran\u00e7ois Romain and architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart, were built without the rows of houses that occupied earlier bridges, and were designed to match the grand style of the architecture around them.[citation needed]\n\nPalaces and monuments\nThe Luxembourg Palace in 1643\nThe Luxembourg Palace in 1643\n\n \nThe Lescot wing from 1546 to 1553 (left of the tower) and Lemercier wing from 1624 to 1639) (right of the tower) in the interior of the Cour Carr\u00e9e of the Louvre, in the Renaissance style\nThe Lescot wing from 1546 to 1553 (left of the tower) and Lemercier wing from 1624 to 1639) (right of the tower) in the interior of the Cour Carr\u00e9e of the Louvre, in the Renaissance style\n\n \nThe Pavillon de l'Horloge of the Louvre Palace (1624\u201339), by Jacques Lemercier\nThe Pavillon de l'Horloge of the Louvre Palace (1624\u201339), by Jacques Lemercier\n\n \nThe colonnade on the east fa\u00e7ade of the Louvre (1667\u201368), by Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay and Claude Perrault, was in the grand classical style of Louis XIV, symbolizing power and grandeur\nThe colonnade on the east fa\u00e7ade of the Louvre (1667\u201368), by Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay and Claude Perrault, was in the grand classical style of Louis XIV, symbolizing power and grandeur\n\nAfter the assassination of Henry IV in 1610, his widow, Marie de' Medici, became the regent for the young Louis XIII and between 1615 and 1631 she built a residence for herself, the Luxembourg Palace, on the left bank. It was inspired by the palaces of her native Florence, but also by the innovations of the French Renaissance. The architect was Salomon de Brosse, followed by Marin de la Vall\u00e9e and Jacques Lemercier. In the gardens, she built a magnificent fountain, the Medici Fountain, also on the Italian model.\n\nThe construction of the Louvre was one of the major Paris architectural projects of the 17th century, and the palace architecture clearly showed the transition from the French Renaissance to the classical style of Louis XIV. Jacques Lemercier had built the Pavillon de l'Orloge in 1624\u201339 in an ornate baroque style. Between 1667 and 1678 Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay and Claude Perrault rebuilt the east exterior fa\u00e7ade of the courtyard with a long colonnade. A competition was held in 1670 for the south fa\u00e7ade, which included a proposal from the Italian architect Bernini. Louis XIV rejected Bernini's Italianate plan in favor of a classical design by Perrault, which had a flat roof concealed by a balustrade and a series of massive columns and triangular pediments designed to convey elegance and power. Louis Le Vau and Claude Perrault rebuilt the interior fa\u00e7ade of the cour Car\u00e9e of the Louvre in a more classical version than that of the facing Renaissance fa\u00e7ade. The Louvre was gradually transformed from a Renaissance and baroque palace to the classical grand style of Louis XIV.[18]\n\nReligious architecture\nThe church of Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont by Claude Gu\u00e9rin, in the late Mannerist Gothic style (1606\u201321)\nThe church of Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont by Claude Gu\u00e9rin, in the late Mannerist Gothic style (1606\u201321)\n\n \nThe Church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais, the first Paris church with a fa\u00e7ade in the new Baroque style (1616\u201320)\nThe Church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais, the first Paris church with a fa\u00e7ade in the new Baroque style (1616\u201320)\n\n \nThe Church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627\u201341) by \u00c9tienne Martellange and Fran\u00e7ois Derand\nThe Church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627\u201341) by \u00c9tienne Martellange and Fran\u00e7ois Derand\n\n \nInterior of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627\u201341)\nInterior of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627\u201341)\n\n \nChurch of Saint-Roch (1653\u201390) by Jacques Lemercier\nChurch of Saint-Roch (1653\u201390) by Jacques Lemercier\n\nChurch architecture in the 17th century was slow to change. Interiors of new parish churches, such as Saint-Sulpice, Saint-Louis-en-l'\u00cele and Saint-Roch largely followed the traditional Gothic floor-plan of Notre-Dame, though they did add fa\u00e7ades and certain other decorative features from the Italian Baroque, and follow the advice of the Council of Trent to integrate themselves into the city's architecture, and they were aligned with the street. In 1675, an official survey on the state of church architecture in Paris made by architects Daniel Gittard and Lib\u00e9ral Bruant recommended that certain churches \"so-called Gothic, without any good order, beauty or harmony\" should be rebuilt \"in the new style of our beautiful modern architecture\", meaning the style imported from Italy, with certain French adaptations.\n\nThe architect Salomon de Brosse (1571\u20131626) introduced a new style of fa\u00e7ade, based on the traditional orders of architecture (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian), placed one above the other. He first used this style in the fa\u00e7ade of the Church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais (1616\u201320). The style of the three superimposed orders appeared again in the Eglise Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis, the new Jesuit church in Paris, designed by the Jesuit architects \u00c9tienne Martellange and Fran\u00e7ois Derand. Saint-Roch (1653\u201390), designed by Jacques Lemercier, had a Gothic plan but colorful Italian-style decoration.[19]\n\nDebut of the dome\nThe former church of the Convent de la Visitation Sainte-Marie, now the Temple du Marais (1632\u201334) by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart\nThe former church of the Convent de la Visitation Sainte-Marie, now the Temple du Marais (1632\u201334) by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart\n\n \nChurch of the Abbey of Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce (1624\u201369) by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart and Pierre Le Muet\nChurch of the Abbey of Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce (1624\u201369) by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart and Pierre Le Muet\n\n \nChapel of the Sorbonne (1634\u201342) by Jacques Lemercier\nChapel of the Sorbonne (1634\u201342) by Jacques Lemercier\n\n \nThe Institut de France (1662\u201368) by Louis Le Vau and Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay\nThe Institut de France (1662\u201368) by Louis Le Vau and Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay\n\n\nThe Church of Les Invalides (1679\u201391), by Jules Hardouin-Mansart\nThe most dramatic new feature of Paris religious architecture in the 17th century was the dome, which was first imported from Italy in about 1630, and began to change the Paris skyline, which hitherto had been entirely dominated by church spires and bell towers. The domed churches began as a weapon of the Counter-Reformation against the architectural austerity of the Protestants. The prototype for the Paris domes was the Church of the Jesu, the Jesuit church in Rome, built in 1568\u201384 by Giacomo della Porta. A very modest dome was created in Paris between 1608 and 1619 in the chapel of the Louanges on rue Bonaparte. (Today it is part of the structure of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts). The first large dome was on the church of Saint-Joseph des Carmes, which was finished in 1630. Modifications in the traditional religious services, strongly supported by the growing monastic orders in Paris, led to modification in church architecture, with more emphasis on the section in the center of the church, beneath the dome. The circle of clear glass windows of the lower part of the dome filled the church center with light.\n\nThe most eloquent early architect of domes was the architect Fran\u00e7ois Mansart. His first dome was at the chapel of the Minimes (later destroyed), then at the chapel of the Church of the Convent of the Visitation Saint-Marie at 17 rue Saint-Antoine (4th arr.), built between 1632 and 1634. Now the Temple du Marais, it is the oldest surviving dome in the city. Another appeared on the Eglise-Saint-Joseph in the convent of the Carmes-dechauss\u00e9s at 70 rue de Vaugirard (6th arr.) between 1628 and 1630. Another dome soon was built in the Marais; the dome of the Church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis at 899-101 rue Saint-Antoine (1627\u201341), by \u00c9tienne Martellange and Fran\u00e7ois Derand. It was followed by church of the Abbey of Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce (5th arr.) (1624\u201369), by Mansart and Pierre Le Muet; then by a dome on the Chapel of Saint-Ursule at the college of the Sorbonne (1632\u201334), by Jacques Lemercier; and the college des Quatres-Nations (now the Institute of France (1662\u201368), by Louis LeVau and Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay; and the church of Notre-Dame de l'Assomption de Paris on rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 (1st arr.) (1670\u201376) by Charles Errard. The most majestic dome was that of the chapel of Les Invalides, by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, built between 1677 and 1706. The last dome of the period was for a Protestant church, the Temple de Pentemont on rue de Grenelle (7th arr.) (about 1700) by Charles de La Fosse.[20]\n\nResidential architecture \u2013 the rustic style\nThe residence of the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (1586)\nThe residence of the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (1586)\n\n \nThe Pavillon de a Reine of Place des Vosges (1605\u201312)\nThe Pavillon de a Reine of Place des Vosges (1605\u201312)\n\n \nThe two remaining original houses of Place Dauphine (1607\u201310)\nThe two remaining original houses of Place Dauphine (1607\u201310)\n\nAn elegant new form of domestic architecture, the rustic style, appeared in Paris in the wealthy Le Marais at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th century. This style of architecture was usually used for ornate apartments in wealthy areas and for h\u00f4tels particuliers. It was sometimes called the \"style of three crayons\" because it used three colors; black slate tiles, red brick, and white stone. This architecture was expensive, having a variety of different materials, and ornate stone work. This style inspired the unique Palais de Versailles. The earliest existing examples are the house known as the Maison de Jacques C\u0153ur at 40 rue des Archives (4th arr.) from the late 16th century; the H\u00f4tel Scipion Sardini at 13 rue Scipion in the (5th arr,) from 1532, and the Abbot's residence at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s at 3-5 rue de l'Abbaye, (6th arr.), from 1586. The most famous examples around found around the Place des Vosges, built between 1605 and 1612. Other good examples are the Hospital of Saint-Louis on rue Buchat (10th arr.) from 1607 to 1611; the two houses at 1-6 Place Dauphine on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, from 1607 to 1612; and the H\u00f4tel d'Alm\u00e9ras at 30 rue des Francs-Bourgeois (4th arr.), from 1612.\n\nResidences \u2013 the classical style\nThe Hotel de Sully at 62 rue Saint-Antoine (4th arr.)

The new residences typically were separated from the street by a wall and gatehouse. There was a large court of honor inside the gates, with galleries on either side, used for receptions, and for services and the stables. The house itself opened both onto the courtyard and onto a separate garden. One good example in its original form, between the Place des Vosges and rue Saint-Antoine, is the H\u00f4tel de Sully, (1624\u201329), built by Jean Androuet du Cerceau.[21]\n\nAfter 1650 the architect Fran\u00e7ois Mansart introduced a more classical and sober style to the h\u00f4tel particulier. The H\u00f4tel de Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud des Brosses at 60 rue des Archives (3rd arrondissement) from 1653 had a greatly simplified and severe fa\u00e7ade. Beginning in the 1660s Mansart remade the fa\u00e7ades of the H\u00f4tel Carnavalet, preserving some of the Renaissance decoration and a 16th portal but integrating them into a more classical composition, with columns, pediments and stone bossage.\n\nThe 18th century \u2013 The triumph of neoclassicism\nThe \u00c9cole Militaire (1751\u201380) by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, combined French classicism with Italian decorative elements\nThe \u00c9cole Militaire (1751\u201380) by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, combined French classicism with Italian decorative elements\n\n \nEntrance to the royal mint, the H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, on quai de Conti (1767\u201373)\nEntrance to the royal mint, the H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, on quai de Conti (1767\u201373)\n\n \nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Europe on place de l'Od\u00e9on (6th arr.)

In 1722, Louis XV returned the court to Versailles, and visited the city only on special occasions.[22] While he rarely came into Paris, he did make important additions to the city's landmarks. His first major building was the \u00c9cole Militaire, a new military school, on the Left Bank. It was built between 1739 and 1745 by Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Gabriel borrowed the design of the Pavillon d'Horloge of the Louvre by Lemercier for the central pavilion, a fa\u00e7ade influenced by Mansart, and Italian touches from Palladio and Giovanni Battista Piranesi.[23]\n\nIn the second part of the century, a more purely neoclassical style, based directly on Greek and Roman models, began to appear. It was strongly influenced by a visit to Rome in 1750 by the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot and the future Marquis de Marigny, the director of buildings for King Louis XV. They and other architects who made the obligatory trip to Italy brought back classical ideas and drawings which defined Paris architecture until the 1830s.[24]\n\nSoufflot's Roman trip led to the design of the new church of Saint Genevieve, now the Panth\u00e9on, the model of the neoclassical style, constructed on the summit of Mont Genevi\u00e9ve between 1764 and 1790. It was not completed until the French Revolution, at which time it became a mausoleum for Revolutionary heroes. Other royal commissions in the new style included the royal mint, the Hotel des Monnaies on the Quai de Conti (6th arr.), with a 117-meter-long fa\u00e7ade along the Seine, dominated by its massive central Avant-corps and vestibule decorated with Doric columns and caisson ceilings (1767\u201375).\n\nReligious architecture\nThe late baroque church of Saint-Roch at 196 rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 (1738\u201339) by Robert de Cotte and Jules-Robert de Cotte\nThe late baroque church of Saint-Roch at 196 rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 (1738\u201339) by Robert de Cotte and Jules-Robert de Cotte\n\n \nThe neoclassical fa\u00e7ade of the church of Saint-Philippe-de-Roule (1764\u201384), by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin\nThe neoclassical fa\u00e7ade of the church of Saint-Philippe-de-Roule (1764\u201384), by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin\n\n \nThe Church of Saint-Genevi\u00e9ve, now the Panth\u00e9on (1764\u201390) by Jacques-Germain Soufflot\nThe Church of Saint-Genevi\u00e9ve, now the Panth\u00e9on (1764\u201390) by Jacques-Germain Soufflot\n\n \nThe unfinished west fa\u00e7ade of the Church of Saint-Eustache, Paris, with its single bell tower (1754\u201378)\nThe unfinished west fa\u00e7ade of the Church of Saint-Eustache, Paris, with its single bell tower (1754\u201378)\n\n \nFacade of the Church of Saint-Sulpice (1732\u201380) by Jean-Nicolas Servandoni, then Oudot de Maclaurin and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin\nFacade of the Church of Saint-Sulpice (1732\u201380) by Jean-Nicolas Servandoni, then Oudot de Maclaurin and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin\n\n \nProject of Couture for the Church of La Madeleine (1777)\nProject of Couture for the Church of La Madeleine (1777)\n\nChurches in the first half of the 18th century, such as the church of Saint-Roche at 196 rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 (1738\u201339) by Robert de Cotte and Jules-Robert de Cotte, stayed with the late baroque style of superimposed orders. Later churches ventured into neoclassicism, at least on the exterior. The most prominent example of a neoclassical church was the Church of Saint Genevieve (1764\u201390), the future Pantheon. The church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule at 153 rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor\u00e9 (8th arr.) (1764\u201384) by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin had an exterior inspired by the early Paleo-Christian church, though the nave in the interior was more traditional. The Church of Saint-Sulpice in the 6th arrondissement, by Jean-Nicolas Servandont, then by Oudot de Maclaurin and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin was given a classical fa\u00e7ade and two bell towers (1732\u201380). Funding was exhausted before the second tower was finished, leaving the two towers different in style. The church of Saint-Eustache on rue-du-Jour (1st arr.) an example of both Gothic and Renaissance architecture, had its west faced redone by Jean Hardouin-Mansart and then Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux, into a neoclassical fa\u00e7ade with two orders (1754\u201378), and was intended to have two towers, but only one was finished.[25]\n\nA large church with a dome, similar to Les Invalides, had been planned for the Place de la Madeleine beginning in the 1760s. the King laid the cornerstone on April 3, 1763, but work halted in 1764. The architect, Pierre Contant d'Ivry, died in 1777, and was replaced by his pupil Guillaume-Martin Couture, who decided instead to base his church on the Roman Pantheon; a classic colonnade topped by a massive dome. At the start of the Revolution of 1789, however, only the foundations and the grand portico had been finished.\n\nR\u00e9gence and Louis XV residential architecture\nDetail of the H\u00f4tel de Chenizot, 51 rue Saint-Louis-en-Ile, by Pierre-Vign\u00e9 de Vigny (about 1720)\nDetail of the H\u00f4tel de Chenizot, 51 rue Saint-Louis-en-Ile, by Pierre-Vign\u00e9 de Vigny (about 1720)\n\n \nThe Hotel d'\u00c9vreux, now the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, residence of the President of France (1718\u201320), by Armand-Claude Mollet\nThe Hotel d'\u00c9vreux, now the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, residence of the President of France (1718\u201320), by Armand-Claude Mollet\n\n \nThe avants-corps of the H\u00f4tel du Ch\u00e2telet (1770) by Mathurin Cherpitel\nThe avants-corps of the H\u00f4tel du Ch\u00e2telet (1770) by Mathurin Cherpitel\n\nThe R\u00e9gence and then the rule of Louis XV saw a gradual evolution of the style of the h\u00f4tel particulier, or mansion. The ornate wrought-iron balcony appeared on residences, along with other ornamental details called rocaille or rococo, often borrowed from Italy. The style first appeared on houses in the Marais, then in the neighborhoods of Saint-Honor\u00e9 and Saint-Germain, where larger building lots were available. These became the most fashionable neighborhoods by the end of the 18th century. The new h\u00f4tels were often ornamented with curve fa\u00e7ades, rotundas and lateral pavilions, and had their fa\u00e7ades decorated with sculpted mascaron fruit, cascades of trophies and other sculptural decoration. The interiors were richly decorated with carved wood panels. The houses usually looked out onto courtyards on the front and gardens to the rear. The H\u00f4tel de Chenizot, 51 rue Saint-Louis-en-Ile, by Pierre-Vign\u00e9 de Vigny (about 1720), was a good example of the new style; it was a 17th-century house transformed by a new rocaille fa\u00e7ade.[26]\n\nUrbanism \u2013 the Place de la Concorde\nDesign of Ange-Jacques Gabriel for Place Louis XV, now the Place de la Concorde (1766\u201375)\nDesign of Ange-Jacques Gabriel for Place Louis XV, now the Place de la Concorde (1766\u201375)\n\n \nFacade of the H\u00f4tel de la Marine on Place de la Concorde (1766\u201375), by Ange-Jacques Gabriel\nFacade of the H\u00f4tel de la Marine on Place de la Concorde (1766\u201375), by Ange-Jacques Gabriel\n\nIn 1748, the Academy of Arts commissioned a monumental statue of the king on horseback by the sculptor Bouchardon, and the Academy of Architecture was assigned to create a square, to be called Place Louis XV, where it could be erected. The site selected was the marshy open space between the Seine, the moat and bridge to the Tuileries Garden, and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which led to the Place de l'\u00c9toile, convergence of hunting trails on the western edge of the city (now Place Charles de Gaulle). The winning plans for the square and buildings next to it were drawn by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Gabriel designed two large h\u00f4tels with a street between them, Rue Royale, designed to give a clear view of the statue in the center of the square. The fa\u00e7ades of the two h\u00f4tels, with long colonnades and classical pediments, were inspired by Perrault's neoclassical fa\u00e7ade of the Louvre. Construction began in 1754, and the statue was put in place and dedicated on 23 February 1763. The two large h\u00f4tels were still unfinished, but the fa\u00e7ades were finished in 1765\u201366. The Place was the theatre for some of the most dramatic events of the French Revolution, including the executions of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.[27]\n\nUrbanism under Louis XVI\nThe later part of the 18th century saw the development of new residential blocks, particularly on the left bank at Od\u00e9on and Saint-Germain, and on the right bank in the first and second arrondissements. The most fashionable neighborhoods moved from the Marais toward the west. with large residential buildings constructed in a simplified and harmonious neoclassical style. The ground floors were often occupied by arcades to give pedestrians shelter from the rain and the traffic in the streets. Strict new building regulations were put into place in 1783 and 1784, which regulated the height of new buildings in relation to the width of the street, regulating the line of the cornice, the number of stories and the slope of the roofs. Under a 1784 decree of the Parlement of Paris, the height of most new buildings was limited to 54 pieds or 17.54 meters, with the height of the attic depending upon the width of the building.[28]\n\nParis architecture on the eve of the Revolution\nView of Paris from the Pont Neuf by Jean-Baptiste Raguenet (1783)\nView of Paris from the Pont Neuf by Jean-Baptiste Raguenet (1783)\n\n \nDemolition of houses on the Pont Notre-Dame, by Hubert Robert (1786)\nDemolition of houses on the Pont Notre-Dame, by Hubert Robert (1786)\n\n \nA neoclassical customs barrier (1787\u201390), now part of Parc Monceau, by Claude Nicolas Ledoux\nA neoclassical customs barrier (1787\u201390), now part of Parc Monceau, by Claude Nicolas Ledoux\n\n \nThe Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons (1774) was monumental, but its tiny spouts provided little water\nThe Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons (1774) was monumental, but its tiny spouts provided little water\n\nParis in the 18th century had many beautiful buildings, but it was not a beautiful city. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau described his disappointment when he first arrived in Paris in 1731: I expected a city as beautiful as it was grand, of an imposing appearance, where you saw only superb streets, and palaces of marble and gold. Instead, when I entered by the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, I saw only narrow, dirty and foul-smelling streets, and villainous black houses, with an air of unhealthiness; beggars, poverty; wagons-drivers, menders of old garments; and vendors of tea and old hats.\"[29]\n\nIn 1749, in Embellissements de Paris, Voltaire wrote: \"We blush with shame to see the public markets, set up in narrow streets, displaying their filth, spreading infection, and causing continual disorders\u2026 Immense neighbourhoods need public places. The center of the city is dark, cramped, hideous, something from the time of the most shameful barbarism.\"[30]\n\nThe uniform neoclassical style all around the city was not welcomed by everyone. Just before the Revolution the journalist Louis-S\u00e9bastien Mercier wrote: \"How monotonous is the genius of our architects! How they live on copies, on eternal repetition! They don't know how to make the smallest building without columns\u2026 They all more or less resemble temples.\"[31]\n\nEven functional buildings were built in the neoclassical style; the grain market (now the Chamber of Commerce) was given a neoclassical dome (1763\u201369) by Nicolas Le Camus de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res. Between 1785 and 1787, the royal government built a new wall around the edges of the city (The Wall of the Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) to prevent smuggling of goods into the city. it had fifty-five barriers, many of them in the form of Doric temples, designed by Claude Nicolas Ledoux. A few still exist, notably at Parc Monceau. The wall was highly unpopular and was an important factor in turning opinion against Louis XVI, and provoking the French Revolution.\n\nIn 1774 Louis XV had constructed a monumental fountain, the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons, richly decorated with classical sculpture by Bouchardon glorifying the King, at 57\u201359 rue de la Grenelle. While the fountain was huge, and dominated the narrow street, it originally had only two small spouts, from which residents of the neighborhood could fill their water containers. It was criticized by Voltaire in a letter to the Count de Caylus in 1739, as the fountain was still under construction:\n\nI have no doubt that Bouchardon will make of this fountain a fine piece of architecture; but what kind of fountain has only two faucets where the water porters will come to fill their buckets? This isn't the way fountains are built in Rome to beautify the city. We need to lift ourselves out of taste that is gross and shabby. Fountains should be built in public places, and viewed from all the gates. There isn't a single public place in the vast faubourg Saint-Germain; that makes my blood boil. Paris is like the statue of Nabuchodonosor, partly made of gold and partly made of muck.[32]\n\nRevolutionary Paris\nRuins of the abbey and church of Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre in 1820\nRuins of the abbey and church of Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre in 1820\n\n \nNotre Dame stripped of its statuary and spire (1820s)\nNotre Dame stripped of its statuary and spire (1820s)\n\n \nRue des Colonnes (1793\u201395)\nRue des Colonnes (1793\u201395)\n\n \nSet for the Festival of the Supreme Being (1794)\nSet for the Festival of the Supreme Being (1794)\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the churches of Paris were closed and nationalized, and many were badly damaged. Most destruction came not from the Revolutionaries, but from the new owners who purchased the buildings, and sometimes destroyed them for the building materials they contained. The Church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre was destroyed, and its church left in ruins. Parts of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s were turned into a gunpowder factory; an explosion destroyed many of the buildings outside the church. The Church of Saint-Genevieve was turned into a mausoleum for revolutionary heroes. The sculpture on the fa\u00e7ade of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame was smashed or removed, and the spire torn down. Many of the abandoned religious buildings, particularly in outer neighborhoods of the city, were turned into factories and workshops. Much of the architecture of the Revolution was theatrical and temporary, such as the extraordinary stage sets created for the Festival of the Supreme Being on the Champs-de-Mars in 1794. However, work continued on some pre-revolutionary projects. The rue des Colonnes in the second arrondissement, designed by Nicolas-Jacques-Antoine Vestier (1793\u20131795), had a colonnade of simple Doric columns, characteristic of the Revolutionary period.[33]\n\nThe Paris of Napoleon (1800\u20131815)\nIntended by Napoleon to be the Museum of Military Glory, the structure became the church of La Madeleine (1763\u20131842)\nIntended by Napoleon to be the Museum of Military Glory, the structure became the church of La Madeleine (1763\u20131842)\n\n \nArc de Triomphe du Carrousel (1806\u201310)\nArc de Triomphe du Carrousel (1806\u201310)\n\n \nThe Arc de Triomphe (1806\u201311) by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin, not finished until 1836\nThe Arc de Triomphe (1806\u201311) by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin, not finished until 1836\n\n \nNapoleon rebuilt the fa\u00e7ade of the Palais Bourbon, the French National Assembly, to match the Temple of Military Glory (now the church of La Madeleine) 1806)\nNapoleon rebuilt the fa\u00e7ade of the Palais Bourbon, the French National Assembly, to match the Temple of Military Glory (now the church of La Madeleine) 1806)\n\n \nThe Vend\u00f4me column, by Jacques Gondouin and Jean-Baptiste Lep\u00e9re, sculpture by \u00c9tienne Bergeret (1806\u20131810)\nThe Vend\u00f4me column, by Jacques Gondouin and Jean-Baptiste Lep\u00e9re, sculpture by \u00c9tienne Bergeret (1806\u20131810)\n\n \nPlace du Ch\u00e2telet and the new Fontaine du Palmier, by \u00c9tienne Bouhot (1810)\nPlace du Ch\u00e2telet and the new Fontaine du Palmier, by \u00c9tienne Bouhot (1810)\n\n \nThe Rue de Rivoli by Charles Percier and Pierre-Fran\u00e7oid-L\u00e9onard Fontaine (1801\u20131835)\nThe Rue de Rivoli by Charles Percier and Pierre-Fran\u00e7oid-L\u00e9onard Fontaine (1801\u20131835)\n\n \nThe Pont des Arts by Louis-Alexandre de Cossart and Jacques-Lacroix Dillon (1801\u20131803, rebuilt in 1984), the first iron bridge in Paris\nThe Pont des Arts by Louis-Alexandre de Cossart and Jacques-Lacroix Dillon (1801\u20131803, rebuilt in 1984), the first iron bridge in Paris\n\n \nThe Paris Bourse, or Paris stock exchange by Alexandre-Th\u00e9odore Brongniart (1808) then \u00c9loi Labarre and Louis-Hippolyte Lebas (1813\u20131826)\nThe Paris Bourse, or Paris stock exchange by Alexandre-Th\u00e9odore Brongniart (1808) then \u00c9loi Labarre and Louis-Hippolyte Lebas (1813\u20131826)\n\n \nDome of the Bourse de Commerce, the former grain market, the first Paris building with a metal frame.

(1811)\n\nMonuments\nIn 1806, in imitation of Ancient Rome, Napol\u00e9on ordered the construction of a series of monuments dedicated to the military glory of France. The first and largest was the Arc de Triomphe, built at the edge of the city at the Barri\u00e8re d'\u00c9toile, and not finished before July 1836. He ordered the building of the smaller Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel (1806\u20131808), copied from the arch of Arch of Septimius Severus and Constantine in Rome, next to the Tuileries Palace. It was crowned with a team of bronze horses he took from the fa\u00e7ade of St Mark's Basilica in Venice. His soldiers celebrated his victories with grand parades around the Carrousel. He also commissioned the building of the Vend\u00f4me Column (1806\u201310), copied from the Trajan's Column in Rome, made of the iron of cannon captured from the Russians and Austrians in 1805. At the end of the Rue de la Concorde (given again its former name of Rue Royale on 27 April 1814), he took the foundations of an unfinished church, the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine, which had been started in 1763, and transformed it into a 'temple \u00e0 la gloire de la Grande Arm\u00e9e', a military shrine to display the statues of France's most famous generals.\n\nMany of Napoleon's contributions to Paris architecture were badly needed improvements to the city's infrastructure; He started a new canal to bring drinking water to the city, rebuilt the city sewers, and began construction of the Rue de Rivoli, to permit the easier circulation of traffic between the east and west of the city.[34] He also began construction of the Palais de la Bourse (1808\u201326), the Paris stock market, with its grand colonnade. it was not finished until 1826. In 1806 he began to build a new fa\u00e7ade for the Palais Bourbon, the modern National Assembly, to match the colonnade of the Temple of Military Glory (now the Madeleine), directly facing it across the Place de La Concorde.[35]\n\nThe Egyptian style\nA sphinx on the balustrade of the Hotel Sal\u00e9 (now the Mus\u00e9e Picasso) (1656\u201359)\nA sphinx on the balustrade of the Hotel Sal\u00e9 (now the Mus\u00e9e Picasso) (1656\u201359)\n\n \nPyramid in the gardens of Parc Monceau (1778)\nPyramid in the gardens of Parc Monceau (1778)\n\n \nThe Fontaine du Fellah at 42 rue de S\u00e8vres by Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Bralle (1807)\nThe Fontaine du Fellah at 42 rue de S\u00e8vres by Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Bralle (1807)\n\n \nSphinx of the Fontaine du Palmier (1808 and 1858)\nSphinx of the Fontaine du Palmier (1808 and 1858)\n\n \nThe Luxor Obelisk erected on the Place de la Concorde in 1836\nThe Luxor Obelisk erected on the Place de la Concorde in 1836\n\n \nThe Luxor movie palace on boulevard de Magenta (1921)\nThe Luxor movie palace on boulevard de Magenta (1921)\n\n \nThe Louvre Pyramid by I.

However, Napoleon's Egyptian campaign gave the style a new prestige, and for the first time it was based on drawings and actual models carried back the scholars who traveled with Napoleon's soldiers to Egypt; the style soon appeared in public fountains and residential architecture, including the Fontaine du Fellah on rue de S\u00e8vres by Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Bralle (1807) and the Fontaine du Palmier by Bralle and Louis Simon Boizot (1808). The sphinxes around this fountain were Second-Empire additions in 1856\u201358 by the city architect of Napoleon III, Gabriel Davioud. The grandest Egyptian element added to Paris was the Luxor Obelisk from the Luxor Temple, offered as a gift by the Viceroy of Egypt to Louis-Philippe, and erected on the Place de la Concorde in 1836. Examples continued to appear in the 20th century, from the Luxor movie palace on boulevard de Magenta in the 10th arrondissement (1921) to the Louvre pyramid by I. M. Pei (1988). [36]\n\nThe debut of iron architecture\nIron architecture made its Paris debut under Napoleon, with the construction of the Pont des Arts by Louis-Alexandre de Cessart and Jacques Lacroix-Dillon (1801\u201303). This was followed by a metal frame for the cupola of the Halle aux bl\u00e9, or grain market (now the Paris Bourse de Commerce, or Chamber of Commerce). Designed by the architect Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph B\u00e9langer and the engineer Fran\u00e7ois Brunet (1811). It replaced the wooden-framed dome built by Nicolas Le Camus de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res in 1767, which burned in 1802. It was the first iron frame used in a Paris building.[37]\n\nThe Restoration (1815\u20131830)\nThe Chapelle expiatoire by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9onard Fontaine (1826)\nThe Chapelle expiatoire by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9onard Fontaine (1826)\n\n \nThe church of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette (1823\u20131836) by Louis-Hippolyte Lebas;\nThe church of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette (1823\u20131836) by Louis-Hippolyte Lebas;\n\n \nThe church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle (1828\u20131830), by \u00c9tienne-Hippolyte Godde\nThe church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle (1828\u20131830), by \u00c9tienne-Hippolyte Godde\n\n \nChurch of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul (1824\u20131844) by Jacques Ignace Hittorff\nChurch of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul (1824\u20131844) by Jacques Ignace Hittorff\n\nPublic buildings and monuments\nThe royal government restored the symbols of the old regime, but continued the construction of most of the monuments and urban projects begun by Napoleon. All of the public buildings and churches of the Restoration were built in a relentlessly neoclassical style. Work resumed, slowly, on the unfinished Arc de Triomphe, begun by Napoleon. At the end of the reign of Louis XVIII, the government decided to transform it from a monument to the victories of Napoleon into a monument celebrating the victory of the Duke of Ang\u00f4uleme over the Spanish revolutionaries who had overthrown their Bourbon king. A new inscription was planned: \"To the Army of the Pyrenees\", but the inscription had not been carved and the work was still not finished when the regime was toppled in 1830.[38]\n\nThe Canal Saint-Martin was finished in 1822, and the building of the Bourse de Paris, or stock market, designed and begun by Alexandre-Th\u00e9odore Brongniart from 1808 to 1813, was modified and completed by \u00c9loi Labarre in 1826. New storehouses for grain near the Arsenal, new slaughterhouses, and new markets were finished. Three new suspension bridges were built over the Seine: the Pont d'Archevech\u00e9, the Pont des Invalides and footbridge of the Gr\u00e8ve. All three were rebuilt later in the century.\n\nReligious architecture\nThe church of La Madeleine, begun under Louis XVI, had been turned by Napoleon into the Temple of Glory (1807). It was now turned back to its original purpose, as the Royal church of La Madeleine. To commemorate the memory of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette to expiate the crime of their execution, King Louis XVIII built the Chapelle expiatoire designed by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9onard Fontaine in a neoclassical style similar to the Paris Pantheon on the site of the small cemetery of the Madeleine, where their remains (now in the Basilica of Saint-Denis) had been hastily buried following their execution. It was completed and dedicated in 1826.\n\nSeveral new churches were begun during the Restoration to replace those destroyed during the Revolution. A battle took place between architects who wanted a neogothic style, modeled after Notre-Dame, or the neoclassical style, modeled after the basilicas of ancient Rome. The battle was won by a majority of neoclassicists on the Commission of Public Buildings, who dominated until 1850. Jean Chalgrin had designed Saint-Philippe de Role before the Revolution in a neoclassical style; it was completed (1823\u201330) by \u00c9tienne-Hippolyte Godde. Godde also completed Chalgrin's project for Saint-Pierre-du-Gros-Caillou (1822\u201329), and built the neoclassic basilicas of Notre-Dame-du-Bonne Nouvelle (1823\u201330) and Saint-Denys-du-Saint-Sacrament (1826\u201335).[39] Other notable neoclassical architects of the Restoration included Louis-Hippolyte Lebas, who built Notre-Dame-de-Lorette (1823\u201336); (1823\u201330); and Jacques Ignace Hittorff, who built the church of Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul (1824\u201344). Hittorff went on to along a brilliant career in the reigns of Louis Philippe and Napoleon III, designing the new plan of the Place de la Concorde and constructing the Gare du Nord railway station (1861\u201366).[40]\n\nCommercial architecture \u2013 the shopping gallery\n\nThe Galerie d'Orleans at the Palais-Royal (1818\u20131829), a shopping arcade covered with a glass roof, by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9onard Fontaine\nA new form of commercial architecture had appeared at the end of the 18th century; the passage, or shopping gallery, a row of shops along a narrow street covered by a glass roof. They were made possible by improved technologies of glass and cast iron, and were popular since few Paris streets had sidewalks and pedestrians had to compete with wagons, carts, animals and crowds of people. The first indoor shopping gallery in Paris had opened at the Palais-Royal in 1786; rows of shops, along with cafes and the first restaurants, were located under the arcade around the garden. It was followed by the passage Feydau in 1790\u201391, the passage du Caire in 1799, and the Passage des Panoramas in 1800.[41] In 1834 the architect Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9onard Fontaine carried the idea a step further, covering an entire courtyard of the Palais-Royal, the Galerie d'Orleans, with a glass skylight. The gallery remained covered until 1935. It was the ancestor of the glass skylights of the Paris department stores of the later 19th century.[42]\n\nResidential architecture\n\nEnglish neoclassical house in the Square d'Orleans (1829\u20131835) by Edward Cresy\nDuring the Restoration, and particularly after the coronation of King Charles X in 1824. New residential neighborhoods were built on the Right Bank, as the city grew to the north and west. Between 1824 and 1826, a time of economic prosperity, the quarters of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Europe, Beaugrenelle and Passy were all laid out and construction began. The width of lots grew larger; from six to eight meters wide for a single house to between twelve and twenty meters for a residential building. The typical new residential building was four to five stories high, with an attic roof sloping forty-five degrees, broken by five to seven windows. The decoration was largely adapted from that of the Rue de Rivoli; horizontal rather than vertical orders, and simpler decoration. The windows were larger and occupied a larger portion of the fa\u00e7ades. Decoration was provided by ornamental iron shutters and then wrought-iron balconies. Variations of this model were the standard on Paris boulevards until the Second Empire.[43]\n\nThe h\u00f4tel particulier, or large private house of the Restoration, usually was built in a neoclassical style, based on Greek architecture or the style of Palladio, particularly in the new residential quarters of Nouvelle Athenes and the Square d'Orleans on Rue Taibout (9th arrondissement), a private residential square (1829\u201335) in the English neoclassical style designed by Edward Cresy. Residents of the square included George Sand and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. Some of the houses in the new quarters in the 8th arrondissement, particularly the quarter of Fran\u00e7ois I, begun in 1822, were made in a more picturesque style, a combination of the Renaissance and classical style, called the Troubadour style. This marked the beginning of the movement away from uniform neoclassicism toward eclectic residential architecture.[43]\n\nThe Paris of Louis-Philippe (1830\u20131848)\nFountain in the Place de la Concorde by Jacques Ignace Hittorff (1840)\nFountain in the Place de la Concorde by Jacques Ignace Hittorff (1840)\n\n \nCourtyard of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts (1832\u20131870) by F\u00e9lix Duban\nCourtyard of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts (1832\u20131870) by F\u00e9lix Duban\n\n \nNeo-Renaissance h\u00f4tel particulier on Place Saint-Georges by \u00c9douard Renaud (1841)\nNeo-Renaissance h\u00f4tel particulier on Place Saint-Georges by \u00c9douard Renaud (1841)\n\n \nInterior of the Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Library (1844\u20131850) by Henri Labrouste\nInterior of the Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Library (1844\u20131850) by Henri Labrouste\n\n \nThe July Column in the Place de la Bastille (1831\u20131840) by Joseph-Louis Duc\nThe July Column in the Place de la Bastille (1831\u20131840) by Joseph-Louis Duc\n\nMonuments and public squares\nThe architectural style of public buildings under the Restoration and Louis-Philippe was determined by the Academie des Beaux-Arts, or Academy of Fine Arts, whose Perpetual Secretary from 1816 to 1839 was Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy, a confirmed neoclassicist. The architectural style of public buildings and monuments was intended to associate Paris with the virtues and glories of ancient Greece and Rome, as it had been under Louis XIV, Napoleon and the Restoration.[44]\n\nThe first great architectural project of the reign of Louis-Philippe was the remaking of the Place de la Concorde into its modern form. The moats of the Tuileries were filled, two large fountains, one representing the maritime commerce and industry of France, the other the river commerce and great rivers of France, designed by Jacques Ignace Hittorff, were put in place, along with monumental sculptures representing the major cities of France.[45] On 25 October 1836, a new centerpiece was put in place; a stone obelisk from Luxor, weighing two hundred fifty tons, brought on a specially built ship from Egypt, was slowly hoisted into place in the presence of Louis-Philippe and a huge crowd.[46] In the same year, the Arc de Triomphe, begun in 1804 by Napoleon, was finally completed and dedicated. Following the return to Paris of the ashes of Napoleon from Saint Helena in 1840, they were placed with great ceremony in a tomb designed by Louis Visconti beneath the church of Les Invalides. Another Paris landmark, the column on the Place de la Bastille, was inaugurated on 28 July 1840, on the anniversary of the July Revolution, and dedicated to those killed during the uprising.\n\nSeveral older monuments were put to new purposes: the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace was purchased by the French state and became an official residence, and under late governments the residence of the Presidents of the French Republic. The Basilica of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, originally built as a church, then, during the Revolution, made into a mausoleum for great Frenchmen, then a church again during the Restoration, once again became the Panth\u00e9on, holding the tombs of great Frenchmen.\n\nPreservation and restoration\nThe reign of Louis-Philippe saw the beginning of a movement to preserve and restore some of the earliest landmarks of Paris, inspired in large part by Victor Hugo's hugely successful novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (Notre-Dame de Paris), published in 1831. The leading figure of the restoration movement was Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, named by Louis-Philippe as the inspector General of Historic Monuments. The Commission of Public Monument was created in 1837, and in 1842, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e began compiling the first official list of classified historical monuments, now known as the Base M\u00e9rim\u00e9e.\n\nThe first structure to be restored was the nave of the church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, the oldest in the city. Work also began in 1843 on the cathedral of Notre Dame, which had been badly damaged during the Revolution, and stripped of the statues on its fa\u00e7ade. Much of the work was directed by the architect and historian Viollet-le-Duc who, sometimes, as he admitted, was guided by his own scholarship of the \"spirit\" of medieval architecture, rather strict historical accuracy. The other major restorations projects were Sainte-Chapelle and the H\u00f4tel de Ville, dating to the 17th century; the old buildings which pressed up against the back of the H\u00f4tel de Ville were cleared away; two new wings were added, the interiors were lavishly redecorated, and the ceilings and walls of the large ceremonial salons were painted with murals by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. Unfortunately, all the interiors were burned in 1871 by the Paris Commune.[46]\n\nThe Beaux-Arts style\nThe \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts by Fran\u00e7ois Debret (1819\u201332) then F\u00e9lix Duban (1832\u201370)\nThe \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts by Fran\u00e7ois Debret (1819\u201332) then F\u00e9lix Duban (1832\u201370)\n\n \nThe Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers by L\u00e9on Vaudoyer (1838\u201367)\nThe Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers by L\u00e9on Vaudoyer (1838\u201367)\n\n \nThe Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Library by Henri Labrouste (1844\u201350)\nThe Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Library by Henri Labrouste (1844\u201350)\n\nAt the same time, a small revolution was taking place at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, led by four young architects; Joseph-Louis Duc, F\u00e9lix Duban, Henri Labrouste and L\u00e9on Vaudoyer, who had first studied Roman and Greek architecture at the Villa Medici in Rome, then in the 1820s began the systematic study of other historic architectural styles, including French architecture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They instituted teaching about a variety of architectural styles at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, and installed fragments of Renaissance and Medieval buildings in the courtyard of the school so students could draw and copy them. Each of them also designed new non-classical buildings in Paris inspired by a variety of different historic styles; Labrouste built the Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Library (1844\u201350); Duc designed the new Palais de Justice and Court of Cassation on the \u00cele-de-la-Cit\u00e9 (1852\u201368); and Vaudroyer designed the Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers (1838\u201367), and Duban designed the new buildings of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. Together, these buildings, drawing upon Renaissance, Gothic and romanesque and other non-classical styles, broke the monopoly of neoclassical architecture in Paris.[47]\n\nThe first train stations\n\nThe first Paris train station, on the site of the modern Gare Saint-Lazare (1837)\nThe first train stations in Paris were called embarcad\u00e8re (a term used for water traffic), and their location was a source of great contention, as each railroad line was owned by a different company, and each went in a different direction. The first embarcad\u00e8re was built by the P\u00e9reire brothers for the line Paris-Saint-Germain-en-Laye, at the Place de l'Europe. It opened on 26 August 1837, and with its success was quickly replaced by a larger building on rue de Stockholm, and then an even larger structure, the beginning of the Gare Saint-Lazare, built between 1841 and 1843. It was the station for the trains to Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Versailles and Rouen.\n\nThe P\u00e9reire brothers argued that Gare Saint-Lazare should be the unique station of Paris, but the owners of the other lines each insisted on having their own station. The first Gare d'Orl\u00e9ans, now known as the Gare d'Austerlitz, was opened on 2 May 1843, and was greatly expanded in 1848 and 1852. The first Gare Montparnasse opened on 10 September 1840 on avenue du Maine, and was the terminus of the new Paris-Versailles line on the left bank of the Seine. It was quickly found to be too small, and was rebuilt between 1848 and 1852 at the junction of rue de Rennes and boulevard du Montparnasse, its present location.[48]\n\nThe banker James Mayer de Rothschild received the permission of the government to build the first railroad line from Paris to the Belgian border in 1845, with branch lines to Calais and Dunkerque. The first embarcad\u00e8re of the new line opened on rue de Dunkerque in 1846. It was replaced by a much grander station, Gare du Nord, in 1854. The first station of the line to eastern France, the Gare de l'Est was begun in 1847, but not finished until 1852. Construction of a new station for the line to the south, from Paris to Montereau-Fault-Yonne began in 1847 and was finished in 1852. In 1855 it was replaced by a new station, the first Gare de Lyon, on the same site.[48]\n\nNapoleon III and the Second Empire style (1848\u20131870)\nSee also: Haussmann's renovation of Paris\nThe avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra painted by Camille Pissarro (1898).\nThe avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra painted by Camille Pissarro (1898).\n\n \nThe grand stairway of the Paris Opera, designed by Charles Garnier, was begun in 1864 but not finished until 1875.\nThe grand stairway of the Paris Opera, designed by Charles Garnier, was begun in 1864 but not finished until 1875.\n\n \nBoulevard Haussmann, with the classic Haussmann-style apartment buildings (1870)\nBoulevard Haussmann, with the classic Haussmann-style apartment buildings (1870)\n\n \nThe reading room of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, site Richelieu (1854\u201375), was designed by Henri Labrouste with an iron frame and glass creating the effect of a cathedral.\nThe reading room of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, site Richelieu (1854\u201375), was designed by Henri Labrouste with an iron frame and glass creating the effect of a cathedral.\n\nThe rapidly growing French economy under Napoleon III led to major changes in the architecture and urban design of Paris. New types of architecture connected with the economic expansion; railroad stations, hotels, office buildings, department stores and exposition halls, occupied the center of Paris, which previously had been largely residential. To improve traffic circulation and bring light and air to the center of the city, Napoleon's Prefect of the Seine, destroyed the crumbling and overcrowded neighborhoods in the heart of the city and built a network of grand boulevards. The expanded use of new building materials, especially iron frames, allowed the construction of much larger buildings for commerce and industry.[49]\n\nThe Paviillon Richelieu of the Louvre, by Hector Lefuel (1857)\nThe Paviillon Richelieu of the Louvre, by Hector Lefuel (1857)\n\n \nThe Court of Cassation by Joseph-Louis Duc (1862\u201368)\nThe Court of Cassation by Joseph-Louis Duc (1862\u201368)\n\n \nThe Tribunal de commerce de Paris by Antoine-Nicolas Bailly (1860\u201365)\nThe Tribunal de commerce de Paris by Antoine-Nicolas Bailly (1860\u201365)\n\n \nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet by Gabriel Davioud (1859\u201362)\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet by Gabriel Davioud (1859\u201362)\n\nWhen he declared himself Emperor in 1852, Napoleon III moved his residence from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the Tuileries Palace, where his uncle Napoleon I had lived, adjoining the Louvre. His Nouveau Louvre project continued the construction of the Louvre, following the grand design of Henry IV; he built the Pavillon Richelieu (1857), the guichets of the Louvre (1867), and rebuilt the Pavillon de Flore; he broke with the neo-classicism of the wings of the Louvre built by Louis XIV; the new constructions were perfectly in harmony with the Renaissance wings.[50]\n\nThe dominant architectural style of the Second Empire was the eclectic, drawing liberally from the architecture of the Gothic style, Renaissance style, and style of Louis XV and Louis XVI. The best example was the Palais Garnier, begun in 1862 but not finished until 1875. The architect was Charles Garnier (1825\u20131898), who won the competition against a Gothic-revival style by Viollet-le-Duc. When asked by the Empress Eugenie what the style of the building was called, he replied simply \"Napoleon III.\" It was at the time the largest theater in the world, but much of the interior space was devoted to purely decorative spaces; grand stairways, huge foyers for promenading, and large private boxes. The fa\u00e7ade was decorated with seventeen different materials, marble, stone, porphyry and bronze. Other notable examples of Second Empire public architecture include the Palais de Justice and the Court of Cassation by Joseph-Louis Duc (1862\u201368); the Tribunal de commerce de Paris by Antoine-Nicolas Bailly (1860\u201365), and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet by Gabriel Davioud (1859\u201362) and Theater de la Ville, facing each other on Place du Ch\u00e2telet.\n\nThe Second Empire also saw the restoration of the famed stained glass windows and structure of Sainte-Chapelle by Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc; and extensive restoration of Notre-Dame de Paris. Later critics complained that some of the restoration was more imaginative than precisely historical.\n\nTemple of Love in the Bois de Vincennes by Gabriel Davioud (1864)\nTemple of Love in the Bois de Vincennes by Gabriel Davioud (1864)\n\n \nFontaine de la Paix, or Fontaine Saint-Michel by Gabriel Davioud (1856\u201361), where the new Boulevard Saint-Michel met the Seine.\nFontaine de la Paix, or Fontaine Saint-Michel by Gabriel Davioud (1856\u201361), where the new Boulevard Saint-Michel met the Seine.\n\n \nCity hall of the 1st arrondissement, in neo-gothic style, by Jacques Ignace Hittorff (1855\u201360)\nCity hall of the 1st arrondissement, in neo-gothic style, by Jacques Ignace Hittorff (1855\u201360)\n\n \nThe neo-gothic bell tower of the city hall of the 1st arrondissement, by Th\u00e9odore Ballu (1862), between the city hall (left) and the Church of Saint-Germain-Auxerois\nThe neo-gothic bell tower of the city hall of the 1st arrondissement, by Th\u00e9odore Ballu (1862), between the city hall (left) and the Church of Saint-Germain-Auxerois\n\nThe map and look of Paris changed dramatically under Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann. Haussmann demolished the narrow streets and crumbling medieval houses in the center of the city (including the house where he was born) and replaced them with wide boulevards lined by large residential buildings, all of the same height (Twenty meters to the cornice, or five stories on boulevards and four on narrower streets), with fa\u00e7ades in the same style, and faced with the same cream-colored stone. He completed the east\u2013west axis of the city center, the Rue de Rivoli begun by Napoleon, built a new north\u2013south axis, Boulevard de S\u00e9bastopol, and cut wide boulevards on both the right and left banks, including the Boulevard Saint-Germain, Boulevard Saint-Michel, usually culminating in a domed landmark. if a dome was not already there, Haussmann had one built, as he did with the Tribunal de commerce de Paris and the Church of Saint-Augustin.\n\nThe centrepiece of the new design was the new Palais Garnier, designed by Charles Garnier. In the latter years of the Empire, he built new boulevards to connect the city center with the eight new arrondissements which Napoleon III attached to the city in 1860, along with new city halls for each arrondissement. New city halls were also built for many of the original arrondissements. The new city hall of the First arrondissement by Jacques Ignace Hittorff (1855\u201360), close the medieval church of Saint-Germain-Auxerois the historic center of the city. The new city hall was in neo-Gothic style, echoing the medieval church, complete with a rose window.\n\nTo provide green space and recreation for the residents of the outer neighborhoods of the city, Haussmann built large new parks Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and Parc des Buttes Chaumont to the west, east, north and south, filled with picturesque garden follies, as well as numerous smaller parks and squares where the new boulevards met. City architect Gabriel Davioud devoted considerable attention to the details of the city infrastructure. Haussmann also built a new water supply and sewer system under the new boulevards, planted thousands of trees along the boulevards, and ornamented the parks and boulevards with kiosks, gateways, lodges and ornamental grills, all designed by Davioud.[51]\n\nReligious architecture - the Neo-Gothic and eclectic styles\nThe Basilica of Sainte-Clothilde by Christian Gau, then Th\u00e9odore Ballu (1841\u201357)\nThe Basilica of Sainte-Clothilde by Christian Gau, then Th\u00e9odore Ballu (1841\u201357)\n\n \nThe church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste-de-Belleville in the neo-Gothic style by Jean-Baptiste Lassus (1854\u201359)\nThe church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste-de-Belleville in the neo-Gothic style by Jean-Baptiste Lassus (1854\u201359)\n\n \nThe Church of Saint Augustine (1860\u201371), by architect Victor Baltard, had a revolutionary iron frame but a classical Neo-Renaissance exterior.\nThe Church of Saint Augustine (1860\u201371), by architect Victor Baltard, had a revolutionary iron frame but a classical Neo-Renaissance exterior.\n\n \nThe interior of Saint-Augustin; with an iron frame supported by iron columns (1860\u201371)\nThe interior of Saint-Augustin; with an iron frame supported by iron columns (1860\u201371)\n\n \nThe church of Saint-Pierre de Montrouge (14th arrondissement) by Emile Vauremer (1863\u201370)\nThe church of Saint-Pierre de Montrouge (14th arrondissement) by Emile Vauremer (1863\u201370)\n\n \nThe church of Saint-Ambroise (11th arrondissement) by Th\u00e9odore Ballu (1863\u201368)\nThe church of Saint-Ambroise (11th arrondissement) by Th\u00e9odore Ballu (1863\u201368)\n\nReligious architecture finally broke away from the neoclassical style which had dominated Paris church architecture since the 18th century. Neo-Gothic and other historical styles began to be built, particularly in the eight new arrondissements farther from the center added by Napoleon III in 1860. The first neo-Gothic church was the Basilica of Sainte-Clothilde, begun by Christian Gau in 1841, finished by Th\u00e9odore Ballu in 1857. During the Second Empire, architects began to use metal frames combined with the Gothic style; the Eglise Saint-Laurent, a 15th-century church rebuilt in Neo-Gothic style by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862\u201365), and Saint-Eugene-Sainte-Cecile by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lusson (1854\u201355); and Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville by Jean-Bapiste Lassus (1854\u201359). The largest new church built in Paris during the Second Empire was Church of Saint Augustine (1860\u201371), by Victor Baltard, the designer of the metal pavilions of the market of Les Halles. While the structure was supported by cast-iron columns, the fa\u00e7ade was eclectic.[52]\n\nRailway stations and commercial architecture\nLes Halles by Victor Baltard (1853\u201370) seen from the roof of the church of Saint-Eustache\nLes Halles by Victor Baltard (1853\u201370) seen from the roof of the church of Saint-Eustache\n\n \nThe interior of one of the giant glass and iron pavilions of Les Halles, (1853\u201370), the central market of Paris, designed by Victor Baltard\nThe interior of one of the giant glass and iron pavilions of Les Halles, (1853\u201370), the central market of Paris, designed by Victor Baltard\n\n \nThe Second-Empire fa\u00e7ade of the Gare du Nord (1861\u201366) by Jacques Ignace Hittorff concealed a vast hall supported by iron columns\nThe Second-Empire fa\u00e7ade of the Gare du Nord (1861\u201366) by Jacques Ignace Hittorff concealed a vast hall supported by iron columns\n\nThe industrial revolution and economic expansion of Paris required much larger structures, particularly for railroad stations, which were considered the new ornamental gateways to the city. The new structures had iron skeletons, but they were concealed by Beaux-Arts fa\u00e7ades. The Gare du Nord, by Jacques Ignace Hittorff (1842\u201365), had a glass roof with iron columns thirty-eight meters high, while the fa\u00e7ade was in the beaux-arts style faced with stone and decorated with statues representing the cities served by the railway.\n\nThe most dramatic use of iron and glass was in the new central market of Paris, Les Halles (1853\u201370), an ensemble of huge iron and glass pavilions designed by Victor Baltard (1805\u20131874). Henri Labrouste (1801\u20131875) used iron and glass to create a dramatic cathedral-like reading room for the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, site Richelieu (1854\u201375).[53]\n\nThe Belle \u00c9poque (1871\u20131913)\nMain article: Paris architecture of the Belle \u00c9poque\nThe architecture of Paris created during the Belle \u00c9poque, between 1871 and the beginning of the First World War in 1914, was notable for its variety of different styles, from Beaux-Arts, neo-Byzantine and neo-Gothic to Art Nouveau, and Art Deco.

In the final days of the Commune, as the French Army recaptured the city, the Communards pulled down the column in Place Vend\u00f4me and burned a number of Paris landmarks, including the 16th-century Tuileries Palace, the 17th-century H\u00f4tel de Ville, the Ministry of Justice, the Cour des Comptes, the Conseil d'Etat, the Palais de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur, the Ministry of Finance, and others. The interior of the Tuileries Palace was completely destroyed, but the walls were still standing. Haussmann and others called for its restoration, but the new government decided it was a symbol of the monarchy and had the walls torn down. (A fragment of the building can be seen today in the Park of the Trocadero). Most of the others were restored to their original appearance. To celebrate the rebuilding of the city the Parisians hosted the first of three universal expositions which attracted millions of visitors to Paris, and transformed the architecture of the city.\n\nThe Paris Universal Exposition of 1878 saw the building of the Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro, an eclectic composition of Moorish, renaissance and other styles, on the hill of Chaillot by Gabriel Davioud and Jules Bourdais (1876\u201378). It was used in the Expositions of 1889 and 1900, and remained until 1937, when it was replaced by the Palais de Chaillot.\nThe Paris Universal Exposition of 1889 celebrated the centenary of the French Revolution. The Eiffel Tower, (1887\u201389), conceived by entrepreneur Gustave Eiffel, and built by engineers Maurice Koechlin and \u00c9mile Nougier and architect Stephen Sauvestre, was the tallest structure in the world, was the gateway to the Exposition, and the Gallery of Machines, designed by Ferdinand Dufert and Victor Contamin, was the largest covered space in the world when it was built.

The Beaux-Arts fa\u00e7ade of the Grand Palais (1897\u20131900), designed by Henri Deglane, Charles Girault, Albert Louvet and Albert Thomas, was a synthesis of the grand neoclassical styles of Louis XIV and Louis XV. concealed a vast interior space covered by a glass roof resting on slender iron pillars. The Petit-Palais (1897\u20131900), by Charles Girault, borrowed elements of Italian Renaissance architecture, and French neoclassical decorative elements from Les Invalides, the hotels beside the Place de la Concorde and the palatial stables of the Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly by Jean Aubert. Its interior was more revolutionary than the Grand Palais; Girault used reinforced concrete and iron to create a winding stairway along brightly lit galleries. The style of these two buildings, along with the colossal neoclassical style of Louis XVI, influenced the design of Paris residential and commercial buildings until 1920.[54]\nThe Art Nouveau became the most famous style of the Belle \u00c9poque, particularly associated with the Paris M\u00e9tro station entrances designed by Hector Guimard, and with a handful of other buildings, including Guimard's Castel B\u00e9ranger (1898) at 14 rue La Fontaine, in the 16th arrondissement, and the ceramic-sculpture covered house by architect Jules Lavirotte at 29 Avenue Rapp (7th arrondissement).[55] The enthusiasm for Art Nouveau did not last long; in 1904 the Guimard Metro entrance at Place de l'Opera it was replaced by a more classical entrance. Beginning in 1912, all the Guimard metro entrances were replaced with functional entrances without decoration.[56]\n\nReligious architecture\nThe Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, designed by Paul Abadie, (1874\u20131914)\nThe Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, designed by Paul Abadie, (1874\u20131914)\n\n \nThe Church of Notre-Dame d'Auteuil by \u00c9mile Vaudremer (1878\u201392)\nThe Church of Notre-Dame d'Auteuil by \u00c9mile Vaudremer (1878\u201392)\n\n \nThe neo-Byzantine church of Saint-Dominque, by L\u00e9on Gaudibert, (1912\u201325)\nThe neo-Byzantine church of Saint-Dominque, by L\u00e9on Gaudibert, (1912\u201325)\n\n \nThe Church of Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre, by Anatole de Baudot (1894)\nThe Church of Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre, by Anatole de Baudot (1894)\n\n \nArt-Nouveau interior of Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre (1894)\nArt-Nouveau interior of Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre (1894)\n\n \nInterior of the Synagogue on Rue Pav\u00e9e, by Hector Guimard, with its discreet Art Nouveau detail (1913)\nInterior of the Synagogue on Rue Pav\u00e9e, by Hector Guimard, with its discreet Art Nouveau detail (1913)\n\nFrom the 1870s until the 1930s the most prominent style for Paris churches was the Romano-Byzantine style; the model and most famous example was the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, by Paul Abadie, whose design won a national exposition. Its construction lasted the entire span of the Belle Epoque, between 1874 and 1913, under three different architects; it was not consecrated until 1919. It was modeled after the romanesque and Byzantine cathedrals of the early Middle Ages, which Abadie had restored. The style also appeared in the church of Notre-Dame d'Auteuil by \u00c9mile Vaudremer (1878\u201392) The church of Saint-Dominque, by Leon Gaudibert, (1912\u201325) followed the style of Byzantine churches, with a massive central dome. The first church in Paris to be constructed of reinforced concrete was Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre, at 19 rue des Abbesses at the foot of Montmartre. The architect was Anatole de Baudot, a student of Viollet-le-Duc. The nature of the revolution was not evident, because Baudot faced the concrete with brick and ceramic tiles in a colorful Art nouveau style, with stained glass windows in the same style.[57]\n\nThe department store and the office building\nInterior of the Bon March\u00e9 department store (1875)\nInterior of the Bon March\u00e9 department store (1875)\n\n \nThe glass cupola of the department store Galeries Lafayette (1912) provides light to the galleries below\nThe glass cupola of the department store Galeries Lafayette (1912) provides light to the galleries below\n\n \nFacade of the headquarters of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, William Bouwens Van der Boijen, in the Beaux-Arts style (1883)\nFacade of the headquarters of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, William Bouwens Van der Boijen, in the Beaux-Arts style (1883)\n\n \nThe grand gallery of the headquarters of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais at 18 rue du quatre septembre, by Victor Laloux (1907)\nThe grand gallery of the headquarters of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais at 18 rue du quatre septembre, by Victor Laloux (1907)\n\n \nCupola of the headquarters of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale at 29 boulevard Haussmann, by Jacques Hermant (1905\u201311)\nCupola of the headquarters of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale at 29 boulevard Haussmann, by Jacques Hermant (1905\u201311)\n\nAristide Boucicaut launched the first modern department store in Paris Au Bon March\u00e9, in 1852. Within twenty years, it had 1,825 employees and an income of more than 20 million francs. In 1869 Boucicault began constructing a much larger store, with an iron frame, a central courtyard covered with a glass skylight. The architect was Louis-Charles Boileau, with assistance from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel. After more enlargements and modifications, the building was finished in 1887, and became the prototype for other department stores in Paris and around the world.[58] Au Bon March\u00e9 was followed by au Louvre in 1865; the Bazar de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville) in 1866, Au Printemps in 1865; La Samaritaine in 1870, and Galeries Lafayette in 1895. All the new stores glass skylights whenever possible to fill the stores with natural light, and designed the balconies around the central courts to provide the maximum of light to each section.[59] Between 1903 and 1907 the architect Frantz Jourdain created the interior and fa\u00e7ades of the new building of La Samaritaine.[60]\n\nThe safety elevator had been invented in 1852 by Elisha Otis, making tall office buildings practical, and the first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building, a ten-story building with a steel frame, had been built in Chicago by Louis Sullivan in 1893\u201394, but Paris architects and clients showed little interest in building tall office buildings. Paris was already the banking and financial capital of the continent, and moreover, as of 1889 it had the tallest structure in the world, the Eiffel Tower. While some Paris architects visited Chicago to see what has happening, no clients wanted to change the familiar skyline of Paris.[61]\n\nThe new office buildings of the Belle \u00c9poque often made use of steel, plate glass, elevators and other new architectural technologies, but they were hidden inside sober neoclassical stone fa\u00e7ades, and the buildings matched the height of the other buildings on Haussmann's boulevards. The headquarters of the bank Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, built in 1883 on the boulevard des Italiens in 1883 by William Bouwens Van der Boijen, was in the Beaux-Arts style on the outside, but inside one of the most modern buildings of its time, using an iron frame and glass skylight to provide ample light to large hall where the title deeds were held. In 1907 the building was updated with a new entrance at 15 rue du Quatre-Septembre, designed by Victor Laloux, who also designed the Gare d'Orsay, now the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay The new entrance featured a striking rotunda with a glass dome over a floor of glass bricks, which allowed the daylight to illuminate the level below, and the three other levels below. The entrance was badly damaged by a fire in 1996; the rotunda was restored, but the only a few elements still remain of the titles hall.[62]\n\nRailroad stations\nGare de Lyon, by architect Marius Toudoire (1895\u20131902).\nGare de Lyon, by architect Marius Toudoire (1895\u20131902).\n\n \nThe Train Bleu caf\u00e9 in the Gare de Lyon, in the ornate Belle \u00c9poque style (1902)\nThe Train Bleu caf\u00e9 in the Gare de Lyon, in the ornate Belle \u00c9poque style (1902)\n\n \nThe clock of the Gare d'Orsay, by Victor Laloux\nThe clock of the Gare d'Orsay, by Victor Laloux\n\n \nInterior of the Gare d'Orsay (now the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay) in about 1900.\nInterior of the Gare d'Orsay (now the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay) in about 1900.\n\nThe Belle \u00c9poque was the golden age of the Paris railroad station; they served as the gateways of the city for the visitors who arrived for the great Expositions. A new Gare de Lyon was built by Marius Toudoire between 1895 and 1902, making the maximum use of glass and iron combined with a picturesque bell tower and Beaux-Arts fa\u00e7ade and decoration. The caf\u00e9 of the station looked down on the platform where the trains arrived. The Gare d'Orsay (now the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay was the first station in the center of the city, on the site of the old Ministry of Finance, burned by the Paris Commune. It was built in 1898\u20131900 in the palatial Beaux-Arts style by architect Victor Laloux. It was the first Paris station to be electrified and to place the train platforms below street level, a model soon copied by New York and other cities.[63]\n\nResidential architecture \u2013 Beaux-Arts to Art Nouveau\nThe H\u00f4tel de Choudens, (1901), by Charles Girault\nThe H\u00f4tel de Choudens, (1901), by Charles Girault\n\n \n27\u201329 quai Anatole-France (7th arr.) by Richard Bouwens van der Boijen (1906)\n27\u201329 quai Anatole-France (7th arr.) by Richard Bouwens van der Boijen (1906)\n\n \nThe Castel B\u00e9ranger by Hector Guimard (1899)\nThe Castel B\u00e9ranger by Hector Guimard (1899)\n\n \nEntrance of the Castel Beranger\nEntrance of the Castel Beranger\n\n \nLavirotte Building by Jules Lavirotte at 29 Avenue Rapp (1901)\nLavirotte Building by Jules Lavirotte at 29 Avenue Rapp (1901)\n\n \nEntrance to building by Jules Lavirotte at 29 Avenue Rapp\nEntrance to building by Jules Lavirotte at 29 Avenue Rapp\n\nPrivate houses and apartment buildings in the Belle \u00c9poque were usually in the Beaux-Arts style, either neo-Renaissanace or neoclassical, or a mixture of the two. A good example is the H\u00f4tel de Choudens (1901) by Charles Girault, built for a client who wanted a house in the style of the Petit Palais, which Giraud had designed. Apartment buildings saw changes in the interiors; with the development of elevators, the apartment of the wealthiest residents moved from the first floor above the street to the top floor. The rooflines of the new apartment buildings also changed, as the city removed the restrictions imposed by Haussmann; the most extravagant example was the apartment building at 27\u201329 quai Anatole-France in 7th arrondissement (1906), which sprouted profusion of turrets, spires and decorative arches, made possible by reinforced concrete.[64]\n\nA competition for new fa\u00e7ades was held in 1898, and one winner was Hector Guimard for the design of a new apartment building, the Castel B\u00e9ranger (1895\u201398), the first Paris building in the Art Nouveau style. The fa\u00e7ade was inspired by the work of the Belgian Art Nouveau pioneer Victor Horta; it used both elements of medieval architecture and curved motifs inspired by plants and flowers. Horta designed every detail of the house, including furniture, wallpaper, door handles and locks. The success of the Castel Beranger led to Guimard's selection to design the entrance of stations of the new Paris M\u00e9tro. In 1901, the fa\u00e7ade competition was won more extravagant architect, Jules Lavirotte, who designed a house for the ceramic maker Alexandre Bigot which was more a work of inhabited sculpture than a building. The fa\u00e7ade was entirely covered with decorative ceramic sculpture. The popularity of Art Nouveau did not last long; the last Paris building in the style was Guimard's own house, the H\u00f4tel Guimard at 122 Avenue Mozart (1909\u201313).[65]\n\nBetween the wars - Art Deco and modernism (1919\u20131939)\nArt Deco\nMain article: Art Deco in Paris\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the Art Deco style, by Auguste Perret (1911\u201312)\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the Art Deco style, by Auguste Perret (1911\u201312)\n\n \nApartment house at 26 Rue Vavin (6th arrondissement) by Henri Sauvage (1913)\nApartment house at 26 Rue Vavin (6th arrondissement) by Henri Sauvage (1913)\n\n \nLa Samaritaine department store, by Henri Sauvage, Paris (1925\u20131928)\nLa Samaritaine department store, by Henri Sauvage, Paris (1925\u20131928)\n\n \nBuilding in the Pacquebot or ocean liner style, 3 boulevard Victor (15th arrondissement), (1935)\nBuilding in the Pacquebot or ocean liner style, 3 boulevard Victor (15th arrondissement), (1935)\n\nThe Art Nouveau had its moment of glory in Paris beginning in 1898, but was out of fashion by 1914. The Art Deco, which appeared just before the war, became the dominant style for major buildings between the wars. The primary building material of the new era was reinforced concrete. The structure of the buildings was clearly expressed on the exterior, and was dominated by horizontal lines, with rows of bow windows and small balconies. They often had classical features, such as rows of columns, but these were expressed in a stark modern form; ornament was kept to a minimum, and statuary and ornament was often applied, as a carved stone plaque on the fa\u00e7ade, rather than expressed in the architecture of the building itself.[66]\n\nThe leading proponents of the Art Deco were Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage. Perret designed the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the first Art Deco building in Paris, in 1913, just before the War. His major achievements between the wars were the building for the Mobilier National (1936) and the Museum of Public Works (1939), now the Economic and Social Council, located on place d'I\u00e9na, with its giant rotunda and columns inspired by ancient Egypt. Sauvage expanded the La Samaritaine department store in 1931, preserving elements of the Art Nouveau interior and fa\u00e7ades, while giving it an Art Deco form. He experimented with new, simpler forms of apartment buildings, including the stepped building, creating terraces for the upper floors, and covered concrete surfaces with white ceramic tile, resembling stone. He also was a pioneer in the use of prefabricated building materials, reducing costs and construction time.\n\nA related Paris fashion between the wars was the Style paquebot, buildings that resembled the ocean liners of the period, with sleek white fa\u00e7ades, rounded corners, white fa\u00e7ades, and nautical railings. They often were built on narrow pieces of land, or on corners. One example is the building at 3 boulevard Victor in the 15th arrondissement, built in 1935.\n\nExposition architecture\nPavillon of the Soviet Union from the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, in the Constructivist style\nPavillon of the Soviet Union from the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, in the Constructivist style\n\n \nThe Palais de Chaillot from the 1937 Paris International Exposition\nThe Palais de Chaillot from the 1937 Paris International Exposition\n\n \nThe Palais de Tokyo, built for the 1937 Exposition, is now the museum of modern art of the city of Paris\nThe Palais de Tokyo, built for the 1937 Exposition, is now the museum of modern art of the city of Paris\n\n \nGrand stairway of the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council, built for the 1937 Exposition by Auguste Perret (1934\u20131948)\nGrand stairway of the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council, built for the 1937 Exposition by Auguste Perret (1934\u20131948)\n\nThe international expositions of the 1920s and 1930s left fewer architectural landmarks than the earlier exhibitions. The 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts had several very modern buildings, the Russian pavilions, the Art Deco H\u00f4tel du collectionneur by \u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann, and the Pavillon d'Esprit by Le Corbusier, but they were all torn down when the exhibit ended. One impressive Art Deco building from the 1934 Colonial Exposition survived; the Museum of the Colonies at la Port Dor\u00e9\u00e9, by Albert Laprade, 89 meters long, with a colonnade and a front wall entirely covered with a bas-relief by Alfred Janniot on the animals, plants, and cultures the theme the cultures of the French colonies. The interior was filled with sculpture and murals from the period, still visible today. Today, the building is the Cit\u00e9 nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration, or museum of the history of immigration.\n\nThe Paris International Exposition of 1937, held on the eve of World War II, was not a popular success; its two largest national pavilions were those of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, facing each other across the central esplanade. The chief architectural legacies were the Palais de Chaillot, where the old Palais de Trocadero had been, by Jacques Carlu, Louis Hippolyte Boileau and L\u00e9on Az\u00e9ma, (1935\u201337), built of concrete and beige stone, and the Palais de Iena, facing it. Both were built in a monumental neoclassical style. The nearby Palais de Tokyo was another exhibit legacy, designed by Andr\u00e9 Auber, Jean-Claude Dondel, Paul Viard and Marcel Dastugue (1934\u20131937), in a similar neoclassic style, with a colonnade. It is now the modern art museum of the city of Paris. Another exhibit legacy is the former Museum of Public Works (1936\u20131948) at Place and Avenue Iena, by Auguste Perret. It contains an impressive rotunda and conference hall with a neoclassical fa\u00e7ade, all built of reinforced concrete. After the War it was converted into the headquarters of the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council.[67]\n\nResidential architecture\nThe Studio Building, Paris, an art deco apartment building by Henri Sauvage (1926)\nThe Studio Building, Paris, an art deco apartment building by Henri Sauvage (1926)\n\n \nThe Villa La Roche, at 10 square du Docteur Blanche in the 16th arrondissement, by Le Corbusier (1923)\nThe Villa La Roche, at 10 square du Docteur Blanche in the 16th arrondissement, by Le Corbusier (1923)\n\n \nResidence and studio of Louis Barillet, Robert Mallet-Stevens (1931\u201332)\nResidence and studio of Louis Barillet, Robert Mallet-Stevens (1931\u201332)\n\n \nVilla by Robert Mallet-Stevens (1927) on rue Mallet-Stevens (16th arrondissement)\nVilla by Robert Mallet-Stevens (1927) on rue Mallet-Stevens (16th arrondissement)\n\n \nThe house of artist Tristan Tzara by Adolf Loos (1927)\nThe house of artist Tristan Tzara by Adolf Loos (1927)\n\n \nThe Maison de Verre or \"Glass house\" built for Doctor Dalace by Pierre Chareau (1927\u20131931)\nThe Maison de Verre or \"Glass house\" built for Doctor Dalace by Pierre Chareau (1927\u20131931)\n\nThe architect Auguste Perret had anticipated modern residential style in 1904, with an Art Deco house of reinforced concrete faced with ceramics on Rue Franklin. Henri Sauvage also made Art Deco residential buildings with clean geometric lines, made of reinforced concrete faced with white ceramic tiles. The architect Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as Le Corbusier went further, designing houses in geometric forms, lacking any ornament. At age of twenty-one worked as an assistant in the office of Perret. In 1922, he opened his own architectural office with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret and built some of his first houses in Paris, notably the Villa La Roche at 10 square du Docteur-Blanche in the 16th arrondissement, built for a Swiss banker and art collector. Built in 1923, it introduced elements found in many of Corbusier's later buildings, including white concrete walls, was constructed in 1923, and introduced many of the themes found in Corbusier's later work, including an interior ramp between levels and horizontal bands of windows. He also designed the furniture for the house. Robert Mallet-Stevens pursued a similar modernist style, composed of geometric shapes, walls of glass, and an absence of ornament. He built a studio and residence with a large glass wall and spiral stairway for glass designer Louis Barillet at 15 square Vergennes (15th arrondissement) and constructed a series of houses for artists, each one different, on what is now known as rue Mallet-Stevens in the 16th arrondissement. One of the most striking houses of the 1920s was the house of artist Tristan Tzara at 15 avenue Junot in the 18th arrondissement, designed by the Austrian architect Adolf Loos. The interior was completely irregular: each room was of a different size, and on a different level. Another unusual house was the Maison de Verre or \"Glass house\" at 31 rue Saint-Guillaume in the 7th arrondissement, built for Doctor Dalace by Pierre Chareau, with Bernard Bijvoet (1927\u201331). It was made entirely of bricks of glass, supported by a metal frame.[68]\n\nModernist buildings built in the 1920s and 1930s were relatively rare. The most characteristic Paris residential architect of the 1920s was Michel Roux-Spitz, who built a series of large luxury apartment buildings in the 1920s and 1930s, mostly in the 6th and 7th arrondissements. The buildings were all built of reinforced concrete, had white walls, often faced with stone, and horizontal rows of three-faced bow windows, a modernized version of the Haussmann apartment buildings on the same streets.[68]\n\nPublic housing\nA block of HBMs, or Habitiations \u00e0 bon march\u00e9, at 99 Avenue Simon-Bolivar\nA block of HBMs, or Habitiations \u00e0 bon march\u00e9, at 99 Avenue Simon-Bolivar\n\n \nFacade of HBM on Avenue Simon-Bolivar\nFacade of HBM on Avenue Simon-Bolivar\n\nBeginning in 1919, soon after the end of World War I, the French government began building public housing on a huge scale, particularly on the vacant land of the former fortifications around the city. The new buildings were called HBMs, or Habitations \u00e0 bon march\u00e9 (Low-cost residences). They were concentrated to the north, east and south of the city, while a more expensive type of housing, the ILM, or Immeubles \u00e0 loyer moyen, or moderate priced residences, intended for the middle class, were built to the west of the city. A special agency of architects was established to design the buildings. The first group of 2,734 new housing units, called the Cit\u00e9 de Montmartre was built between the Portes of Clignancourt and Montmartre between 1922 and 1928. The new buildings were constructed of concrete and brick. The earliest buildings had many decorative elements, particularly at the roofline, including concrete pergolas. The decoration became less over the years, and over time the brick gave way gradually to reinforced concrete fa\u00e7ades.[69]\n\nReligious architecture\nChurch of Saint-Esprit, 186 avenue Daumesnil (12th arr.) by Paul Tournon (1928\u201332), has modern exterior and massive reinforced concrete Byzantine dome.\nChurch of Saint-Esprit, 186 avenue Daumesnil (12th arr.) by Paul Tournon (1928\u201332), has modern exterior and massive reinforced concrete Byzantine dome.\n\n \nThe church of Sainte-Odile at 2 avenue Stephane-Mallarm\u00e9 (17th) (1935\u20131939) has the highest bell tower in Paris\nThe church of Sainte-Odile at 2 avenue Stephane-Mallarm\u00e9 (17th) (1935\u20131939) has the highest bell tower in Paris\n\n \nThe Grand Mosque of Paris (1920\u20131924) built to honor the Muslim soldiers who died fighting for France in World War I.\nThe Grand Mosque of Paris (1920\u20131924) built to honor the Muslim soldiers who died fighting for France in World War I.\n\nSeveral new churches were built in Paris between the wars, in varied styles. The \u00c9glise du Saint-Esprit (1928\u201332), located at 186 Avenue Daumesnil in the 12th arrondissement, was designed by Paul Tournon. It has a modern exterior made of reinforced concrete covered with red brick and a modern bell tower 75 meters high, but the central feature is a huge dome, 22 meters in diameter. The design, like that of the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica, was inspired by Byzantine churches. The interior was decorated with murals by several notable artists, including Maurice Denis. The \u00c9glise Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot, at 31 avenue Marceau (16th), was designed by \u00c9mile Bois (1932\u201338). Its tower and massive Romanesque entrance was inspired by the churches of the P\u00e9rigord region.[70] The Church of Sainte-Odile at 2 Avenue Stephane-Mallarm\u00e9 (17th arrondissement), by Jacques Barges (1935\u201339) has a single nave, three neo-Byzantine cupolas, and the highest bell tower in Paris.[71]\n\nThe Grand Mosque of Paris was one of the more unusual buildings constructed during the period. Intended to honor the Muslim soldiers from the French colonies who died for France during the war, it was designed by the architect Maurice Tranchant de Lunel, and built and decorated with the assistance of craftsmen from North Africa. The project was funded by the National Assembly in 1920, construction began in 1922, and it was completed in 1924, and dedicated by the President of France, Gaston Doumergue, and the Sultan of Morocco, Moulay Youssef. The style was termed \"Hispano-Moorish\" and the design was largely influenced by the Grand Mosque of Fez, Morocco.[66]\n\nAfter World War II (1946\u20132000)\nThe triumph of modernism\nThe Maison de la Radio (16th arrondissement) by Henry Bernard (1953\u20131963)\nThe Maison de la Radio (16th arrondissement) by Henry Bernard (1953\u20131963)\n\n \nThe headquarters of UNESCO (7th arrondissement) by Marcel Breuer, (1954\u20131958)\nThe headquarters of UNESCO (7th arrondissement) by Marcel Breuer, (1954\u20131958)\n\n \nHeadquarters of the French Communist Party at place du Colonel Fabien, by Oscar Niemeyer (1968\u20131971)\nHeadquarters of the French Communist Party at place du Colonel Fabien, by Oscar Niemeyer (1968\u20131971)\n\n \nInterior of the auditorium of the headquarters of the French Communist Party, by Oscar Niemeyer\nInterior of the auditorium of the headquarters of the French Communist Party, by Oscar Niemeyer\n\nIn the years after World War II, modernism became the official style for public buildings, both because it was new and fashionable, and partly because it was usually less expensive to build. Buildings were designed to express their function, using simple geometric forms, with a minimum of ornament and decoration. They were usually designed so that every office had its own window and view. The materials of choice were reinforced concrete, sometimes covered with aluminium panels, and glass. The term \"Palais\" used for many public buildings before the war was replaced by the more modest term \"Maison\", or \"House.\" In place of decoration, the buildings often contained works of sculpture in interior courtyards and were surrounded by gardens. There was little if anything specifically French about the new buildings; they resembled modernist buildings in the United States and other parts of Europe, and, particularly under President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, were often designed by internationally famous architects from other countries.\n\nAmong the earliest and most influential of the new public buildings was the Maison de la Radio (1952\u20131963), the headquarters of French national radio and television, along the Seine in the 16th arrondissement, designed by Henry Bernard. Bernard had studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, won the Prix de Rome, and eventually became the head of the Academy of Beaux-Arts, but he converted with enthusiasm to the new style. The Maison de la Radio was composed of two circular buildings fitted one inside the other, an outer circle facing the river, with a thousand offices, an inner circle made up of studios, and a 68-meter tall tower in the center, which contains the archives. It was originally designed with a concrete fa\u00e7ade on the outer building, but it was modified and covered with a skin of aluminium and glass. It was described by its builders as a continuation toward the west of the line of great monuments beside the Seine: the Louvre, the Grand Palais, and Palais de Chaillot.[72]\n\nOther major public buildings in the monumental modernist style included the headquarters of UNESCO, the United Nations cultural headquarters, on Place Fontenoy in the 7th arrondissement, by Marcel Breuer, Bernard Zehrfuss and Pier Luigi Nervi (1954\u20131958), in the form of a tripod of three wings made of reinforced concrete, with gardens between the wings. Each office in the building benefited from natural light and an exterior view.[73] The headquarters of the French Communist Party at 2 Place du Colonel Fabien (19th arrondissement), was designed by Oscar Niemeyer, who had just finished designing Bras\u00edlia, the new Brazilian capital city. It was constructed between 1969 and 1980 and was an eight-story block built on columns above the street, with a smooth undulating glass fa\u00e7ade. The auditorium next to the building was half buried underground, covered by a concrete dome that allowed light to enter.[74]\n\nPresidential projects\nFurther information: Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\nThe Centre Georges Pompidou by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers (1977)\nThe Centre Georges Pompidou by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers (1977)\n\n \nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, a conversion of a 19th-century train station (1978\u20131986) by Gae Aulenti\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, a conversion of a 19th-century train station (1978\u20131986) by Gae Aulenti\n\n \nPyramid of the Grand Louvre (1983\u20131989), by I.

The first was Georges Pompidou, a noted admirer and patron of modern art, who made plans for what became, after his death in 1974, the Centre Pompidou. It was designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, and expressed all of its mechanical functions on the exterior of the building, with brightly colored pipes, ducts and escalators. The principal architectural projects begun by his successor, Giscard d'Estaing, were the conversion of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, a central railroad station transformed into a museum devoted to 19th-century French art (1978\u201386), and the City of Sciences and Industry (1980\u201386) in the Parc de la Villette in the 19th arrondissement, whose features included the La G\u00e9ode, a geodesic sphere 36 meters in diameter made of polished stainless steel, now containing an omnimax theater (1980\u201386), designed by Adrien Feinsilber.[75]\n\nBetween 1981 and 1995, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had fourteen years in power, enough time to complete more projects than any president since Napoleon III. In the case of the Louvre Pyramid, he personally selected the architect, without a competition. He completed the projects begun by Giscard d'Estaing and began even more ambitious projects of his own, many of them designed for the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution in 1989. His Grands travaux (\"Great Works\") included the Institut du Monde Arabe by architect Jean Nouvel, finished in 1987; the Grand Louvre, including the glass pyramid (1983\u201389) designed by I. M. Pei; the Grande Arche of La D\u00e9fense by the Danish architect Johan Otto von Spreckelsen, a building in the form of a giant ceremonial arch, which marked the western end of the historical axis that began at the Louvre (inaugurated July 1989); the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, by architect Carlos Ott, opened on 13 July 1989, the day before the bicentennial of the French Revolution, and a new building for the Ministries of the Economy and Finance, at Bercy (12th arrondissement) (1982\u201388), a massive building next to the Seine which resembled both a gateway to the city and a huge bridge with its feet in the river, designed by Paul Chemetov and Borja Huidobro. His last project was located on the other side of the Seine from the Finance Ministry; a group of four book-shaped glass towers for the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (1989\u201395), designed by Dominique Perrault. The books were stored in the towers, while the reading rooms were located beneath a terrace between the buildings, with windows looking out onto a garden.[75][76]\n\nThe age of towers\nThe Eiffel Tower 324 meters (1889)\nThe Eiffel Tower 324 meters (1889)\n\n \nThe Front de Seine project in the 15th arrondissement (1970s)\nThe Front de Seine project in the 15th arrondissement (1970s)\n\n \nTour Montparnasse, 210 meters (1973)\nTour Montparnasse, 210 meters (1973)\n\n \nTowers in the 13th arrondissement (1970s)\nTowers in the 13th arrondissement (1970s)\n\n \nTour First in La D\u00e9fense, 225 meters (1974)\nTour First in La D\u00e9fense, 225 meters (1974)\n\n \nThe business district of La D\u00e9fense, to the west of Paris\nThe business district of La D\u00e9fense, to the west of Paris\n\nUntil the 1960s there were no tall buildings in Paris to share the skyline with the Eiffel Tower, the tallest structure in the city; a strict height limit of thirty-five meters was in place. However, in October 1958, under the Fifth Republic, in order to permit the construction of more housing and office buildings, the rules began to change. A new urban plan for the city was adopted by the municipal council in 1959. Higher buildings were permitted, as long as they met both technical and aesthetic standards. The first new tower to be constructed was an apartment building, the Tour Croulebarbe, at 33 rue Croulebarbe in the 13th arrondissement. It was twenty-two stories, and 61 meters high, and was completed in 1961. Between 1960 and 1975, about 160 new buildings higher than fifteen stories were constructed in Paris, more than half of them in the 13th and 15th arrondissements. Most of them were about one hundred meters high; several clusters of high-rises the work one developer, Michel Holley, who built the towers of Place d'Italie, Front de Seine, and Hauts de Belleville.[77]\n\nTwo of the projects of residential towers were especially large: 29 hectares along the banks of the Seine at Beaugrenelle, and 87 hectares between Place de l'Italie and Tolbiac. Blocks of old buildings were torn town and replaced with residential towers.[78]\n\nBetween 1959 and 1968, the old Montparnasse railway station was demolished and rebuilt nearby, making a large parcel of land available for construction. The municipal council learned of the project only indirectly, through a message from the ministry in charge of construction projects. The first plan, proposed in 1957, was a new headquarters for Air France, a state-owned enterprise, in a tower 150 meters high. In 1959, the proposed height was increased to 170 meters. In 1965, to protect the views in the historic part of the city, the municipal council declared that the new building should be shorter, so it would not visible from the esplanade of Les Invalides. In 1967, the Prefect of Paris, representing the government of President de Gaulle, overruled the municipal council decision, raised the height to two hundred meters, to create more rentable office space. The new building, built between 1969 and 1972, was (and still is) the tallest building within the city limits.[78]\n\nThe growing number of skyscrapers appearing on the Paris skyline provoked resistance from the Paris population. In 1975, President Giscard d'Estaing declared a moratorium on new towers within the city, and in 1977 the City of Paris was given a new Plan d'Occupation des Sols (POS) or Land use plan, which imposed a height limit of twenty-five meters in the center of Paris and 31 meters in the outer arrondissements. Also, new buildings are required to be constructed right up to the sidewalk, without setbacks, further discouraging very tall buildings.[79] The building of skyscrapers continued outside of Paris, particularly in the new business district of La D\u00e9fense.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, the tallest structure in the City of Paris and the \u00cele-de-France was still the Eiffel Tower in the 7th arrondissement, 324 meters high, completed in 1889. The tallest building in the Paris region was the Tour First, at 225 meters, located in La D\u00e9fense built in 1974.\n\nPublic housing \u2013 the HLM and the barre\n\nHLM, or public housing project, in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis\nAfter the War Paris faced a severe housing shortage; most of the housing in the city dated to the 19th century and was in terrible condition. Only two thousand new housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1950. The number rose to 4,230 in 1951 and more than 10,000 in 1956. The office of public housing of the City of Paris acquired the cheapest land it could buy, at the edges of the city. In 1961, when land within the city was exhausted, they were authorized to begin buying land in the surrounding suburbs. The first postwar social housing buildings were relatively low- three or four stories. Much larger buildings began to appear in the mid-1950s. They were built with prefabricated materials and placed in clusters. They were known as HLMs, or Habitations \u00e0 loyer moder\u00e9, or moderate-cost housing. A larger type of HLM began to appear in the mid-1950s, known as a barre, because it was longer than it was high. The usually had between 200 and 300 apartments, were built in clusters, and were often some distance from shops and public transportation. They were welcomed by the families who lived there in the 1950s and early 1960s, but in later years they were crowded with recent immigrants and suffered from crime, drugs and social unrest.[80]\n\nContemporary (2001\u2013present )\nParis architecture since 2000 has been very diverse, with no single dominant style. In the field of museums and monuments, the most prominent name has been Jean Nouvel. His earlier work in Paris included the Institut du Monde Arabe (1982\u201387), and the Fondation Cartier (1992\u201394), which features a glass screen between the building and the street. In 2006 he completed the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly, the Presidential project of Jacques Chirac, a museum presenting the cultures of Asia, Africa and the Americas. It also included a glass screen between the building and the street, as well as a fa\u00e7ade covered with living plants. In 2015, he completed the new Philharmonie de Paris at Parc de la Villette.[81]\n\nThe American architect Frank Gehry also made a notable contribution to Paris architect, for his American Center in Bercy (1994), which became the home of the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in 2005; and for the building of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a museum of modern and contemporary art in the Bois de Boulogne.\n\nMus\u00e9e du Quai Branly by Jean Nouvel (2006)\nMus\u00e9e du Quai Branly by Jean Nouvel (2006)\n\n \nThe Louis Vuitton Foundation building by Frank Gehry (2014)\nThe Louis Vuitton Foundation building by Frank Gehry (2014)\n\n \nThe H\u00f4tel Berlier (1986\u201389), by Dominique Perrault\nThe H\u00f4tel Berlier (1986\u201389), by Dominique Perrault\n\n \nA flour mill and grain storage warehouse were turned into campus buildings for the Paris Diderot University (2002\u201307)\nA flour mill and grain storage warehouse were turned into campus buildings for the Paris Diderot University (2002\u201307)\n\n \nA recent Paris HLM on rue de la Sa\u00efda in the 15th arrondissement\nA recent Paris HLM on rue de la Sa\u00efda in the 15th arrondissement\n\n \nCath\u00e9drale orthodoxe russe de la Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 by Jean-Michel Wilmotte (2013\u201316)\nCath\u00e9drale orthodoxe russe de la Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 by Jean-Michel Wilmotte (2013\u201316)\n\nSupermodernism\nA notable new style of French architecture, called Supermodernism by critic Hans Ibeling, gives precedence to the visual sensations, spatial and tactile, of the viewer looking at the fa\u00e7ade. The best-known architects in this school are Jean Nouvel and Dominique Perrault.\n\nThe H\u00f4tel Berlier (1986\u201389) by Dominique Perrault, an office building at 26-34 rue Bruneseau in the 13th arrondissement, is a block of glass, whose structure is nearly invisible. Perrault also designed the new French National Library.\nThe headquarters of the newspaper Le Monde at 74\u201384 boulevard August-Blanqui in the 13th arrondissement, designed by Christian de Portzamparc (2005), has a fa\u00e7ade that resembles the front page of the newspaper.\nThe administration building of the French Ministry of Culture at 182 rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 (2002\u201304), by Francis Soler and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Druot, is an older structure whose fa\u00e7ade is completely covered with an ornamental metal mesh.\nThe H\u00f4tel Fouquet's Barri\u00e8re at 2 rue Vernet, 23 rue Quentin-Bauchart and 46 avenue George-V, in the 8th arrondissement, designed by \u00c9douard Fran\u00e7ois, is covered by a skin of concrete which is a molding of the fa\u00e7ade of an historic neighboring building.\nEcological architecture\nOne important theme of early-21st-century Paris architecture was making buildings that were ecologically friendly.\n\nThe \"Flower-Tower\" built in 2004 by \u00c9douard Fran\u00e7ois, located at 23 rue-Albert-Roussel in the 17th arrondissement, is covered with the living foliage of bamboo plants, placed in concrete pots at the edges of the terraces on each floor, and watered automatically.\nThe fa\u00e7ade of the university restaurant building at 3 rue Mabillon in the 6th arrondissement, built in 1954, was recovered by architect Patrick Mauger with the logs of trees, to provide better thermal isolation.\nA public housing hostel for the homeless, the Centre d'hebergement Emma\u00fcs, designed by Emmanuel Saadi in 2011, located at 179 quai de Valmy in the 10th arrondissement, is entirely covered by photo-voltaic panels for generating solar electricity.[82]\nConversions\nAnother important theme in 21st-century Parisian architecture is the conversion of older industrial or commercial buildings for new purposes, called in French \"reconversions\" or \"transcriptions\".\n\nA large grain warehouse and flour mill in the 13th arrondissement were converted between 2002 and 2007 into buildings for the Paris Diderot University campus. The architects were Nicolas Michelin and Rudy Ricciotti.\nLes Docks, a large warehouse structure built before World War I alongside the Seine at 34 quai d'Austerlitz, was converted 2005\u201308 into the City of Fashion and Design, by means of a \"plug-over\" of ramps, stairways and passages. The architects were Jakob + MacFarlane.[83]\nPublic housing\nSince the 1980s the more recent constructions of HLMs, or public housing, in Paris have tried to avoid the massive and monotonous structures of the past, with more picturesque architectural detail, variety of styles, greater use of color, and large complexes broken into smaller mini-neighborhoods. The new style, called fragmentation, was particularly pioneered by architects Christian de Portzamparc and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Borel. In one complex on rue Pierre-Rebi\u00e8re in the 17th arrondissement the 180 residences were designed by nine different teams of architects.

A crucial factor in this development, coined the Roman Architectural Revolution, was the invention of concrete. Social elements such as wealth and high population densities in cities forced the ancient Romans to discover new (architectural) solutions of their own. The use of vaults and arches together with a sound knowledge of building materials, for example, enabled them to achieve unprecedented successes in the construction of imposing structures for public use.\n\nNotable examples in France during the period are Alyscamps in Arles and Maison Carr\u00e9e in N\u00eemes. The Alyscamps is a large Roman necropolis, which is a short distance outside the walls of the old town of Arles. It was one of the most famous necropolises of the ancient world. The name is a corruption of the Latin Elisii Campi (that is, Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es or Elysian Fields). They were famous in the Middle Ages and are referred to by Ariosto in Orlando Furioso and by Dante in the Inferno.[1] The Alyscamps continued to be used well into medieval times, although the removal of Saint Trophimus' relics to the cathedral in 1152 reduced its prestige.\n\nPre-Romanesque\nMain articles: Merovingian architecture and Carolingian architecture\nThe unification of the Frankish kingdom under Clovis I (465\u2013511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power-houses of the Merovingian church. Plans often continued the Roman basilica tradition, but also took influences from as far away as Syria and Armenia. In the East, most structures were in timber, but stone was more common for significant buildings in the West and in the southern areas that later fell under Merovingian rule. Most major churches have been rebuilt, usually more than once, but many Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology. The description in Bishop Gregory of Tours' History of the Franks of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at Tours by Saint Perpetuus (bishop 460\u2013490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: \"Saint-Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque\".[2] A feature of the basilica of Saint-Martin that became a hallmark of Frankish church architecture was the sarcophagus or reliquary of the saint raised to be visible and sited axially behind the altar, sometimes in the apse. There are no Roman precedents for this Frankish innovation.[3] A number of other buildings, now lost, including the Merovingian foundations of Saint-Denis, St. Gereon in Cologne, and the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s in Paris, are described as similarly ornate.\n\n\nCluny Abbey\nRomanesque\nMain article: French Romanesque architecture\nSee also: List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches\nArchitecture of a Romanesque style developed simultaneously in parts of France in the 10th century and prior to the later influence of the Abbey of Cluny. The style, sometimes called \"First Romanesque\" or \"Lombard Romanesque\", is characterised by thick walls, lack of sculpture and the presence of rhythmic ornamental arches known as a Lombard band. The Angoul\u00eame Cathedral is one of several instances in which the Byzantine churches of Constantinople seem to have been influential in the design in which the main spaces are roofed by domes. This structure has necessitated the use of very thick walls, and massive piers from which the domes spring. There are radiating chapels around the apse, which is a typically French feature and was to evolve into the chevette. Notre-Dame in Domfront, Normandy is a cruciform church with a short apsidal east end. The nave has lost its aisle, and has probably some of its length. The crossing has a tower that rises in two differentiated stages and is surmounted by a pyramidical spire of a type seen widely in France and Germany and also on Norman towers in England. The Abbey of Fongombault in France shows the influence of the Abbey of Cluny. The cruciform plan is clearly visible. There is a chevette of chapels surrounding the chance apse. The crossing is surmounted by a tower. The transepts end with gables.\n\nThe Saint-\u00c9tienne located in Caen presents one of the best known Romanesque facades of Northern France, with three portals leading into the nave and aisles, and a simple arrangement of identical windows between the buttresses of the tall towers. Begun in the 1060s, it was a prototype for Gothic facades. The spires and the pinnacles, which appear to rise inevitably from the towers, are of the early 13th century. The Trinit\u00e9 Church of Caen has a greater emphasis on the central portal and the arrangement of the windows above it. The decoration of the towers begins at a lower level to that at Saint-\u00c9tienne, giving them weight and distinction. The upper balustrades are additions in the Classical style. The facade of Le Puy-en-Velay in Haute-Loire has a complex arrangement of openings and blind arcades that was to become a feature of French Gothic facades. It is made even richer by the polychrome brick used in diverse patterns, including checkerboard, also a feature of ceramic decoration of Spanish churches of this period. The profile of the aisles is screened by open arches, perhaps for bells. Angoul\u00eame Cathedral is another richly decorated facade, but here it is of dressed stone with sculpture as the main ornament. The manner of arrangement of the various arches is not unlike that at Le Puy-en-Velay, but forming five strong vertical divisions which suggests that the nave is framed by two aisles on each side. In fact, the church has no aisles and is roofed by domes. The figurative sculpture, in common with much Romanesque sculpture, is not closely integrated to the arched spaces into which it has been set.\n\nAt Autun Cathedral, the pattern of the nave bays and aisles extends beyond the crossing and into the chancel, each aisle terminating in an apse. Each nave bay is separated at the vault by a transverse rib. Each transept projects to the width of two nave bays. The entrance has a narthex which screens the main portal This type of entrance was to be elaborated in the Gothic period on the transepts at Chartres.\n\n\nChartres Cathedral\nMedieval\nMain article: French Gothic architecture\nFrench Gothic architecture is a style of architecture prevalent in France from 1140 until about 1500, which largely divided into four styles, Early Gothic, High Gothic, Rayonnant, Late Gothic or Flamboyant style. The Early Gothic style began in 1140 and was characterized by the adoption of the pointed arch and transition from late Romanesque architecture. To heighten the wall, builders divided it into four tiers: arcade (arches and piers), gallery, triforium, and clerestorey. To support the higher wall builders invented the flying buttresses, which reached maturity only at High Gothic during the 13th century. The vaults were six ribbed sexpartite vaults. Notable structures of the style include the East end of the Abbey Church of St Denis, Sens Cathedral, Notre-Dame of Laon, the West facade of Chartres Cathedral, Notre-Dame de Paris, Lyon Cathedral and Toul Cathedral.\n\nThe High Gothic style of the 13th century canonized proportions and shapes from early Gothic and developed them further to achieve light, yet tall and majestic structures. The wall structure was modified from four to only three tiers: arcade, triforium, and clerestorey. Piers coronations were smaller to avoid stopping the visual upward thrust. The clerestorey windows changed from one window in each segment, holed in the wall, to two windows united by a small rose window. The rib vault changed from six to four ribs. The flying buttresses matured, and after they were embraced at Notre-Dame de Paris and Notre-Dame de Chartres, they became the canonical way to support high walls, as they served both structural and ornamental purposes. The main body of Chartres Cathedral (1194\u20131260), Amiens Cathedral, and Bourges Cathedral are also representatives of the style.\n\nAside from these Gothic styles, there is another style called \"Gothique M\u00e9ridional\" (or Southern Gothic, opposed to Gothique Septentrional or Northern Gothic). This style is characterised by a large nave and has no transept. Examples of this Gothic architecture would be Notre-Dame-de-Lamouguier in Narbonne and Sainte-Marie in Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges.\n\n\nThe river gallery of the Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau, designed by Philibert Delorme and Jean Bullant\nRenaissance\nMain article: French Renaissance architecture\nDuring the early years of the 16th century the French were involved in wars in northern Italy, bringing back to France not just the Renaissance art treasures as their war booty, but also stylistic ideas. In the Loire Valley a wave of building was carried and many Renaissance chateaux appeared at this time, the earliest example being the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise (c. 1495) in which Leonardo da Vinci spent his last years. The style became dominant under Francis I (See Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley).\n\nThe style progressively developed into a French Mannerism known as the Henry II style under architects such as Sebastiano Serlio, who was engaged after 1540 in work at the Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau. At Fontainebleau Italian artists such as Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco Primaticcio, and Niccolo dell' Abbate formed the First School of Fontainebleau. Architects such as Philibert Delorme, Androuet du Cerceau, Giacomo Vignola, and Pierre Lescot, were inspired by the new ideas. The southwest interior facade of the Cour Carree of the Louvre in Paris was designed by Lescot and covered with exterior carvings by Jean Goujon. Architecture continued to thrive in the reigns of Henry II and Henry III.\n\n\nCh\u00e2teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte\n\nPalace of Versailles\nBaroque\nMain article: French Baroque architecture\nFrench Baroque is a form of Baroque architecture that evolved in France during the reigns of Louis XIII (1610\u201343), Louis XIV (1643\u20131714) and Louis XV (1714\u201374). French Baroque profoundly influenced 18th-century secular architecture throughout Europe. Although the open three wing layout of the palace was established in France as the canonical solution as early as the 16th century, it was the Palais du Luxembourg (1615\u201320) by Salomon de Brosse that determined the sober and classicizing direction that French Baroque architecture was to take. For the first time, the corps de logis was emphasized as the representative main part of the building, while the side wings were treated as hierarchically inferior and appropriately scaled down. The medieval tower has been completely replaced by the central projection in the shape of a monumental three-storey gateway.\n\nProbably the most accomplished formulator of the new manner was Fran\u00e7ois Mansart, credited with introducing the full Baroque to France. In his design for Ch\u00e2teau de Maisons (1642), Mansart succeeded in reconciling academic and baroque approaches, while demonstrating respect for the gothic-inherited idiosyncrasies of the French tradition. Maisons-Laffitte illustrates the ongoing transition from the post-medieval chateaux of the 16th century to the villa-like country houses of the eighteenth. The structure is strictly symmetrical, with an order applied to each story, mostly in pilaster form. The frontispiece, crowned with a separate aggrandized roof, is infused with remarkable plasticity and the whole ensemble reads like a three-dimensional whole. Mansart's structures are stripped of overblown decorative effects, so typical of contemporary Rome. Italian Baroque influence is muted and relegated to the field of decorative ornamentation.\n\nThe next step in the development of European residential architecture involved the integration of the gardens in the composition of the palace, as is exemplified by Vaux-le-Vicomte (1656\u201361), where the architect Louis Le Vau, the designer Charles Le Brun and the gardener Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre complemented each other. From the main cornice to a low plinth, the miniature palace is clothed in the so-called \"colossal order\", which makes the structure look more impressive. The creative collaboration of Le Vau and Le N\u00f4tre marked the arrival of the \"Magnificent Manner\" which allowed to extend Baroque architecture outside the palace walls and transform the surrounding landscape into an immaculate mosaic of expansive vistas.\n\nRococo\nSee also: French Rococo and Neoclassicism and Rococo\nRococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design. Louis XIV's succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion. By the end of the old king's reign, rich Baroque designs were giving way to lighter elements with more curves and natural patterns. These elements are obvious in the architectural designs of Nicolas Pineau. During the R\u00e9gence, court life moved away from Versailles and this artistic change became well established, first in the royal palace and then throughout French high society. The delicacy and playfulness of Rococo designs is often seen as perfectly in tune with the excesses of Louis XV's regime.\n\nThe 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France. Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Eastern designs and asymmetric compositions. The style had spread beyond architecture and furniture to painting and sculpture. The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications. It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, Bohemia, and Austria, where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.\n\n\nArc de Triomphe of Place de l'\u00c9toile\nNeoclassicism\nMain articles: Neoclassicism in France, French Restoration style, Directoire style, and Empire style\nThe first phase of neoclassicism in France is expressed in the \"Louis XVI style\" of architects like Ange-Jacques Gabriel (Petit Trianon, 1762\u201368); the second phase, in the styles called Directoire and \"Empire\", might be characterized by Jean Chalgrin's severe astylar Arc de Triomphe (designed in 1806). In England the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of Robert Adam, the second by those of Sir John Soane. The interior style in France was initially a Parisian style, the \"Go\u00fbt grec\" (\"Greek style\") not a court style. Only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1771 did Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, bring the \"Louis XVI\" style to court.\n\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to neoclassicism that is called the Greek Revival. Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in academic art through the 19th century and beyond\u2014 a constant antithesis to Romanticism or Gothic revivals\u2014 although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles. By the mid-19th century, several European cities - notably St Petersburg, Athens, Berlin and Munich - were transformed into veritable museums of Neoclassical architecture. By comparison, the Greek revival in France was never popular with either the State or the public. What little there is started with Charles de Wailly's crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles (1773\u201380), and Claude Nicolas Ledoux's Barriere des Bonshommes (1785-9). First-hand evidence of Greek architecture was of very little importance to the French, due to the influence of Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines that sought to discern the principles of the Greeks instead of their mere practices. It would take until Laboustre's Neo-Grec of the second Empire for the Greek revival to flower briefly in France.\n\n\nFormer Government House in Cayenne, French Guiana, begun 1729\nEarly French Colonial Architecture\nMain article: French Colonial\nFrom the early 17th century to the 1830s the French possessed huge tracts of territory in North America, the Caribbean, French Guiana, Senegal and Benin. This empire included the richest colony in the world, Saint-Domingue (Haiti) and France's largest landmass in Nouvelle-France (now Quebec). From 1604, French colonists and government engineers built massive, expensive buildings on the model of Versailles and the grand palaces, townhouses, and churches of Paris in places like Quebec City, Cap-Francois (now Cap-Haitien), Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint-Louis, Senegal, Gor\u00e9e Senegal, and French Guiana. The most palatial were the Chateau St. Louis in Quebec city, the Government building in Cap-Francois, the Governor's mansion in Cayenne, and the church (now cathedral) in Cap-Haitien (now Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral, Cap-Ha\u00eftien). The French also built extensive structures in Louisiana, especially in New Orleans and plantation country Destrehan Plantation, although very little survives today from the French period. Nevertheless, French-style buildings were built there for a long time, as they were in post-colonial Haiti, notably the Sans-Souci Palace of King Henry Christophe.[4]\n\nSecond Empire\nFurther information: Second Empire architecture and Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann\nDuring the mid-19th century when Napoleon III established the Second Empire, Paris became a glamorous city of tall, imposing buildings. Many homes were embellished with details such as paired columns and elaborate wrought iron cresting appeared along rooftops. But the most striking feature borrowed from this period is the steep, boxy mansard roof. You can recognize a mansard roof by its trapezoid shape. Unlike a triangular gable, a mansard roof is almost vertical until the very top, when it abruptly flattens. This singular roofline creates a sense of majesty, and also allows more usable living space in the attic. In the United States, Second Empire is a Victorian style. However, you can also find the practical and the decidedly French mansard roof on many contemporary homes.\n\nBeaux Arts\nMain article: Beaux-Arts architecture\nAnother Parisian style, Beaux-Arts originated from the legendary \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts (School of Fine Arts). Flourishing during the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a grandiose elaboration on the more refined neoclassical style. Symmetrical fa\u00e7ades were ornamented with lavish details such as swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. These massive, imposing homes were almost always constructed of stone and were reserved for only the very wealthy. However a more 'humble' home might show Beaux Arts influences if it has stone balconies and masonry ornaments. Many American architects studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts, and the style strongly influenced United States architecture from about 1880 to 1920.\n\n\nThe Grand Palais (1897-1900) in Paris, built in the style of Beaux-Arts architecture\nArt Nouveau & Art Deco\nMain articles: Art Nouveau and Art Deco\nModernist and Contemporary\n\nNotre-Dame du Haut, in Ronchamp by Le Corbusier\nSome renowned modernist and contemporary French designers and architects include:\n\nLe Corbusier\nRobert Mallet-Stevens\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Borel,\nDominique Perrault,\nChristian de Portzamparc\nJean Nouvel\nList of Post World War II French architects\nExamples of modernist and contemporary buildings in France\nVilla Savoye\nNotre Dame du Haut \u2013 \"Chapel du Ronchamp\"\nLe Corbusier buildings\nVilla Noailles\nInstitut du Monde Arabe\nJean Nouvel buildings\nRegional architecture\nFurther information: Architecture of Provence and Architecture of Normandy\n\nA typical villa of Normandy in the seaside town of Deauville.\nFrench style can vary from being very modern to rustic and antique in appearance.\n\nProvincial\nOne of the most distinctive characteristics of many French buildings is the tall second story windows, often arched at the top, that break through the cornice and rise above the eaves. This unusual window design is especially noticeable on America's examples of French provincial architecture. Modeled after country manors in the French provinces, these brick or stucco homes are stately and formal. They have steep hipped roofs and a square, symmetrical shape with windows balanced on each side of the entrance. The tall second story windows add to the sense of height.\n\nNormandy\nIn Normandy and the Loire Valley of France, farm silos were often attached to the main living quarters instead of a separate barn. After World War I, Americans romanticized the traditional French farmhouse, creating a style known as French Normandy. Sided with stone, stucco, or brick, these homes may suggest the Tudor style with decorative half timbering (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal strips of wood set in masonry). The French Normandy style is distinguished by a round stone tower topped by a cone-shaped roof. The tower is usually placed near the centre, serving as the entrance to the home. French Normandy and French provincial details are often combined to create a style simply called French Country or French Rural carved or embossed on mouldings, sconces, and banisters.\n\n\nThe Presidential Palace of Vietnam, in Hanoi, was built between 1900 and 1906 to house the French Governor-General of Indochina.\n\nMaison Bequette-Ribault in Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve, Missouri\nOverseas architecture\nMain article: French Colonial\nFrench Colonial is a style of architecture used by the French during colonization. Many former French colonies, especially those in Southeast Asia, have previously been reluctant to promote their colonial architecture as an asset for tourism; however, in recent times, the new generation of local authorities has somewhat 'embraced' the architecture and advertise it.[5]\n\nAmerica\nFrench Creole architecture is an American Colonial style that developed in the early 18th century in the Mississippi Valley, especially in Louisiana. French Creole buildings borrow traditions from France, the Caribbean, and many other parts of the world such as Spanish, African, Native American, and other heritages. French Creole homes from the Colonial period were especially designed for the hot, wet climate of that region. Traditional French Creole homes had some or all of these features:\n\nTimber frame with brick or \"Bousillage\" (mud combined with moss and animal hair)\nWide hipped roof extends over porches\nThin wooden columns\nLiving quarters raised above ground level\nWide porches, called \"galleries\"\nNo interior hallways\nPorches used as passageway between rooms\nFrench doors (doors with many small panes of glass)\n", "Coordinates: 48\u00b051\u203258\u2033N 2\u00b018\u203245\u2033E\nGrand Palais\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nThis article is about the palace located in Paris, France.

Construction of the Grand Palais began in 1897 following the demolition of the Palais de l'Industrie (Palace of Industry) to prepare for the Universal Exposition of 1900.[2] That exposition also produced the adjacent Petit Palais and Pont Alexandre III.[3]\n\nThe building was designed to be a large-scale venue for official artistic events. A pediment on the building refers to this function with an inscription that reads, \"a monument dedicated by the Republic to the glory of French art.\" Designed according to Beaux-Arts tastes, the building features ornate stone facades, glass vaults and period innovations that included iron and light steel framing and reinforced concrete.[4]\n\nIt is listed as a historic monument (monument historique) by the Ministry of Culture.[5]\n\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n2\tWartime and the Palais\n3\tAfter war\n4\tGrand Palais today\n5\tSee also\n6\tNotes\n7\tExternal links\nHistory\n\nParis Air Show, 1909, Grand Palais, Paris\nThe decision to hold the Universal Exposition of 1900 in Paris revealed deep divisions within the French Republic. Critics viewed the project as an economic drain that pulled resources away from provincial governments and questioned the benefit that it would bring to the French economy as a whole. These concerns extended to the planning and construction of the Grand Palais.[6]\n\nUnlike plans for the Trocad\u00e9ro or the Garnier opera house, only French architects were considered for the project. The final decision was announced on 22 April 1896, with a contract awarded to four people, each with a distinct area of responsibility: Henri Deglane, Albert Louvet, Albert Thomas and Charles Girault.\n\nThe grand opening was held on 1 May 1900. From the very beginning the palace was the site of different kinds of shows in addition to the intended art exhibitions. These included a riding competition that took place annually from 1901 to 1957, but were mainly dedicated to innovation and modernity: the automobile, aviation, household appliances, and so on. The golden age of the art exhibitions as such lasted for some thirty years, while the last took place in 1947. The first major Henri Matisse retrospective after his death was held at the Grand Palais.\n\nThe main space, almost 240 metres long, was constructed with an iron, steel and glass barrel-vaulted roof, making it the last of the large transparent structures inspired by London's Crystal Palace that were necessary for large gatherings of people before the age of electricity. The main space was originally connected to the other parts of the palace along an east\u2013west axis by a grand staircase in a style combining Classical and Art Nouveau, but the interior layout has since been somewhat modified.\n\nThe exterior of this massive palace combines an imposing Classical stone fa\u00e7ade with a riot of Art Nouveau ironwork, and a number of allegorical statue groups including work by sculptors Paul Gasq, Camille Lef\u00e8vre, Alfred Boucher, Alphonse-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Cordonnier and Raoul Verlet. A monumental bronze quadriga by Georges R\u00e9cipon tops each wing of the main fa\u00e7ade. The one on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es side depicts Immortality prevailing over Time, the one on the Seine side Harmony triumphing over Discord.\n\nThe structure had problems that started even before it was completed, mainly as a result of subsidence caused by a drop in the water table. The builders attempted to compensate for this subsidence, and for a tendency of the ground to shift, by sinking supporting posts down to firmer soil, since construction could not be delayed. These measures were only partially successful. Further damage occurred once the building was in use. Excessive force applied to structural members during the installation of certain exhibitions such as the Exposition Internationale de la Locomotion A\u00e9rienne caused damage, as did acid runoff from the horse shows. Additional problems due to the construction of the building itself revealed themselves over the course of time. Differential rates of expansion and contraction between cast iron and steel members, for example, allowed for water to enter, leading to corrosion and further weakening. When finally one of the glass ceiling panels fell in 1993, the main space had to be closed for restoration work, and was not fully reopened to the public until 2007.\n\nWartime and the Palais\n\nGrand Palais during World War I, 1916\nThe Palais served as a military hospital during World War I, employing local artists who had not been deployed to the front to decorate hospital rooms or to make moulds for prosthetic limbs.\n\nThe Nazis put the Palais to use during the Occupation of France in World War II. First used as a truck depot, the Palais then housed two Nazi propaganda exhibitions.[7]\n\nThe Parisian resistance used the Grand Palais as a headquarters during the Liberation of Paris. On 23 August 1944, an advancing German column was fired upon from a window on the Avenue de S\u00e8lves, and the Germans responded with a tank attack upon the Palais. The attack ignited hay that was set up for a circus show, and over the next 48 hours, thick black smoke from the fire caused serious damage to the building. By 26 August, American jeeps were parked in the nave, followed by tanks from the French 2nd Armored Division, completing the liberation of the building.[8][9]\n\nAfter war\nIn the 1960s, Le Corbusier wanted the Grand Palais to be demolished to set up the Museum of 20th Century Art there, which Andr\u00e9 Malraux had entrusted to him. The death of the architect, on August 27, 1965, put an end to the project.[10]\n\nBy decree of June 12, 1975, the nave is classified as historical monuments. A new decree of November 6, 2000 protects the Grand Palais in its entirety.\n\nGrand Palais today\n\nThe Grand Palais seen from Pont Alexandre III\n\nThe interior\nThe Grand Palais has a major police station in the basement whose officers help protect the exhibits on show in the Galeries nationales du Grand Palais, particularly the picture exhibition \"salons\": the Salon de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux Arts, Salon d'Automne, and Salon Comparaisons. The building's west wing also contains a science museum, the Palais de la D\u00e9couverte.\n\nIt was the host venue of the 2010 World Fencing Championships.\n\nFor the 2011, Monumenta exhibition (11 May to 23 June), sculptor Anish Kapoor was commissioned to create the temporary indoor site-specific installation, Leviathan, an enormous (ca. 775,000 square feet) structure that filled half of the main exhibition hall of the Grand Palais.[11]\n\nIt was used during the final stage of the Tour de France in 2017, as part of the promotion for Paris' 2024 Summer Olympics bid. The riders rode through the Palais en route to the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\n\nPanoramic view of the Grand Palais\n\nARTPARIS 2011 preparation at Grand Palais\nThe Grand Palais temporarily closed to the public in March 2021 for significant renovation works. It will re-open in time for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where it will host the fencing and taekwondo events. It is planned that the Grand Palais will re-open to the public in the Spring of 2025.[12] While it is shut, exhibitions that would otherwise be held there will be hosted by other locations, such as the Grand Palais \u00c9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re and the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris and the Palais de la Bourse in Marseille.\n\nSee also\nflag\tFrance portal\nList of most visited art museums\nList of most visited museums\nPetit Palais\nPalais de la D\u00e9couverte\nPont Alexandre-III\nLouis Levacher\nF\u00e9lix Charpentier, maker of a Grand Palais sculpture.\nNotes\n The Art Newspaper Review, April 2018\n \"L'Exposition Universelle de 1900\".\n \"Grand Palais\".

Nouvel studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and was a founding member of Mars 1976 and Syndicat de l'Architecture, France\u2019s first labor union for architects. He has obtained a number of prestigious distinctions over the course of his career, including the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (for the Institut du Monde Arabe which Nouvel designed), the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2005 and the Pritzker Prize in 2008.[1][2][3][4] A number of museums and architectural centres have presented retrospectives of his work.[5][6]\n\n\nContents\n1\tFamily and education\n2\tPractice\n3\tPritzker Prize\n4\tArchitectural style\n5\tProjects\n5.1\tNotable works\n5.2\tUnder construction\n5.3\tProposed\n5.4\tAbandoned projects\n6\tAwards and honors\n6.1\tIndividual distinctions\n6.2\tDistinctions for projects\n6.3\tRetrospectives\n7\tReferences\n8\tExternal links\nFamily and education\nNouvel was born on 12 August 1945 in Fumel, France. He is the son of Ren\u00e9e and Roger Nouvel, who were teachers. When his father became the county's chief school superintendent, his family moved often. His parents encouraged Nouvel to study mathematics and language but when he was 16 years old he was captivated by art when a teacher taught him drawing. Although he later said he thought that his parents were guiding him to pursue a career in education or engineering, the family reached a compromise: he could study architecture, which they thought was less risky, as a profession, than art.[4]\n\nWhen Nouvel failed an entrance examination at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts of Bordeaux, he moved to Paris, where he won first prize in a national competition to attend the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts. From 1967 to 1970, he earned his income as an assistant to architects Claude Parent and Paul Virilio, who, after only one year, made him a project manager in charge of building a large apartment complex.[4]\n\nNouvel and the filmmaker Odile Fillion have two sons: Bertrand, a post-doctorate computer scientist working at Mindstorm Multitouch in London, and Pierre, a theater producer and designer at his company, Factoid. With his second wife, Catherine Richard, Nouvel has a daughter, Sarah. His third wife, Lida Guan, is a Chinese architect who worked with Nouvel.[7] He is currently living with Mia H\u00e4gg, a Swedish architect whose practice, Habiter Autrement (HA), is based in Paris.[4]\n\nPractice\n\nTorre Aig\u00fces de Barcelona (Agbar), Barcelona\nBy age 25, Nouvel completed school and entered into his own partnership with Fran\u00e7ois Seigneur. Early in his career, Nouvel became a key participant in intellectual debates about architecture in France: in 1976, he co-founded the Mars 1976 movement, a backlash against corporatism in architecture, and, a year later, the Syndicat de l'Architecture. For 15 years, he designed exhibits for the Biennale de Paris,[5] where he made contacts in the arts and theater.[4] Nouvel was one of the organizers of the competition for the rejuvenation of the Les Halles district (1977) and, in 1980, founded the first Paris architecture biennale.\n\nIn 1981, Nouvel, together with Architecture-Studio, won the design competition for the Institut du Monde Arabe (Arab World Institute) building in Paris, whose construction was completed in 1987 and brought Nouvel international fame. Mechanical lenses reminiscent of Arabic latticework in its south wall open and shut automatically, controlling interior lighting as the lenses' photoelectric cells respond to exterior light levels.[4]\n\nNouvel had three different partners between 1972 and 1984: Gilbert Lezenes, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Guyot, and Pierre Soria. In 1985, with his junior architects Emmanuel Blamont, Jean-Marc Ibos and Mirto Vitart, he founded Jean Nouvel et Associ\u00e9s. Then, with Emmanuel Gattani, he formed JNEC in 1988. In 1994, he founded Ateliers Jean Nouvel, his present practice, with Michel P\u00e9lissi\u00e9. Today, it is one of the largest architectural practices in France. Its main office in Paris employs 140 people. In addition, Ateliers Jean Nouvel has site offices in Rome, Geneva, Madrid, and Barcelona. The company is working on 30 active projects in 13 countries.[4]\n\n\nSteel Matte silverware for Georg Jensen (2005)\nNouvel has also designed products and furniture including cutlery for Georg Jensen in 2005,[8] a flacon for a limited edition Yves Saint Laurent fragrance (L'Homme, 2008),[9] and in 2012, the So So collection for American furniture manufacturer Emeco.[10]\n\nPritzker Prize\n\nCulture and Convention Center (2000) in Lucerne\nNouvel was awarded the Pritzker Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2008, for his work on more than 200 projects,[11] among them, in the words of The New York Times, the \"exotically louvered\" Arab World Institute, the bullet-shaped and \"candy-colored\" Torre Agbar in Barcelona, the \"muscular\" Guthrie Theater with its cantilevered bridge in Minneapolis, and in Paris, the \"defiant, mysterious, and wildly eccentric\" Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly (2006) and the Philharmonie de Paris (a \"trip into the unknown\" c. 2012).[3][11]\n\nPritzker points to several more major works: in Europe, the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art (1994), the Culture and Convention Center in Lucerne (2000), the Op\u00e9ra Nouvel in Lyon (1993), Expo 2002 in Switzerland and, under construction, the Copenhagen Concert Hall and the courthouse in Nantes (2000); as well as two tall towers in planning in North America, Tour Verre in New York City and a cancelled condominium tower in Los Angeles.[4]\n\nIn its citation, the jury of the Pritzker prize noted:\n\nOf the many phrases that might be used to describe the career of architect Jean Nouvel, foremost are those that emphasize his courageous pursuit of new ideas and his challenge of accepted norms in order to stretch the boundaries of the field. [...] The jury acknowledged the 'persistence, imagination, exuberance, and, above all, an insatiable urge for creative experimentation' as qualities abundant in Nouvel's work.[4]\n\nArchitectural style\nIn its biographical sketch of Nouvel, the Pritzker site quotes Bill Lacy's One Hundred Contemporary Architects: \"Since the beginning of his architectural career in the 1970s, [Nouvel] has broken the aesthetic of modernism and post-modernism to create a stylistic language all his own. He places enormous importance on designing a building harmonious with its surroundings.\"[12]\n\n\"I am often presented as an architect of \u2018French high tech,\u2019\" Nouvel said, in a talk he gave in Milan in April 1995. \"I would like to begin by explaining what I mean by the term modernity: Modernity is alive, it is not some historical movement that was interrupted a few decades ago. Modernity is making the best use of our memory and moving ahead as fast as we can in terms of development.\"[13]\n\nWriting in The Architectural Review, Andrew Ayers quoted Nouvel's 1980 aper\u00e7u, \"The future of architecture is no longer architectural,\" by which the architect meant that \"rather than remaining a closed discipline, as it seemed to be in the technocratic France of the time, \u2018architecture needed to seek its sources in the culture of today, in other disciplines\u2019, and fully embrace the nature of the society of which it was the ultimate expression.\" Noting cinema's influence on Nouvel as well as the architect's affinity for postmodern philosophy, he added, \"At its best, when [Nouvel] doesn\u2019t overdo it, his is an approach that can enchant with its theatrical blurring of boundaries, its poetic feeling for atmosphere and its light-hearted play with signs and signifiers: the winking mechanical mashrabiyas of the Institut du Monde Arabe, the tree-filled mise en abyme of the crystalline Fondation Cartier, or the pluie de lumi\u00e8re that filters through the intricate metal-mesh dome of the Louvre Abu Dhabi.\"[14]\n\n\"At his boldest, Nouvel is at the edge of what\" the postmodern philosopher and media theorist Jean Baudrillard \"called 'the sparkle and violence of American cities,'\" wrote Amelia Stein, in The Guardian. \"Both critics and admirers have commented that he eschews a formal language and, in a 2008 profile, the New York Times wrote that Nouvel\u2019s work lacks even a 'readily apparent common sensibility.' 'They\u2019re very right to say that,' Nouvel says, with quiet intensity, then a smile. 'I\u2019m very proud of that. I\u2019m not a painter or a writer; I don\u2019t work in my room, I work in different cities with different people. I\u2019m more akin to a movie-maker who makes movies on completely different subjects. To reduce style to the adoption of a formal language is such a short-sighted vision that if anybody is reproaching me for this, I would reproach their reproach.'\u201d[15]\n\nProjects\nMain article: List of Jean Nouvel works\n\nGasometer A in Vienna (2001)\n\nMonolith for Expo.02 in Switzerland (2002)\n\nSerpentine Gallery Pavilion (2010)\n\nTower 25, Nicosia, Cyprus (2011)\nNouvel has designed a number of notable buildings across the world, the most significant of which are listed below. As part of the announcement of Nouvel's Pritzker Prize, the Hyatt Foundation, which awards the prize, published a full illustrated list of Nouvel's architectural work, including projects which were never built, projects in construction, and designs for which construction has yet to start.[16][17] In 2001, the director Beat Kuert filmed a documentary about five of Nouvel's projects, titled Jean Nouvel.\n\nNotable works\n1987 \u2013 Nemausus 1 (Housing, 114 apartments), N\u00eemes, France\n1987 \u2013 Arab World Institute (together with Architecture-Studio), Paris, France[18]\n1994 \u2013 Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain (Office / Cultural), Paris, France[19]\n1995 \u2013 Euralille, (Retail / Office / Housing), Lille, France\n2000 \u2013 Culture and Convention Center (Performance Space / Conference Hall / Museum / Restaurant), Lucerne, Switzerland\n2000 \u2013 Palais de Justice, Nantes, France\n2001 \u2013 Golden Angel (Zlat\u00fd And\u011bl), Prague, Czech Republic\n2002 \u2013 Monolith of Expo.02, Murten, Switzerland\n2004 \u2013 Torre Agbar (Office), Barcelona, Spain[20]\n2004 \u2013 Museum Two, Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul, South Korea[21]\n2005 \u2013 Reina Sof\u00eda Museum expansion, Madrid, Spain\n2006 \u2013 Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly, Paris, France\n2006 \u2013 Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis, MN, USA\n2009 \u2013 Copenhagen Concert Hall, Copenhagen, Denmark[22]\n2010 \u2013 100 Eleventh Avenue, Manhattan, NY, USA.[23][24]\n2010 \u2013 Serpentine Gallery temporary pavilion, London[25]\n2010 \u2013 One New Change, London\n2011 \u2013 Tower 25 in Nicosia\n2012 \u2013 Doha Tower skyscraper, Doha, Qatar[26]\n2012 \u2013 City Hall, Montpellier.[27]\n2015 \u2013 Philharmonie de Paris, Paris[28]\n2015 \u2013 Tour Bleue, Charleroi[29]\n2016 \u2013 Le Nouvel Residences, Kuala Lumpur\n2017 \u2013 Louvre Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\n2018 \u2013 La Marseillaise, Marseille, France[30]\n2019 \u2013 National Museum of Qatar, Doha, Qatar\n2022 - Cidade Matarazzo Rosewood Hotel, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nUnder construction\nThe Sharaan resort in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to be carved into a sandstone hill in the AlUla desert.[31]\nThe Central Park redevelopment plan in Sydney will see 11 new buildings in partnership with architects such as Norman Foster to recreate an abandoned brewery occupying almost four inner-city blocks. Nouvel's 120-meter One Central Park is his first project in Australia, and will feature a cantilevered mirror hanging over the central square off of the side of the building.\nThe Stelios Ioannou Learning Resource Center is an under construction project for the University of Cyprus in Nicosia. The project is expected to be completed in 2019.[32]\nIn November 2006, Hines commissioned Nouvel to build a new 82-story tower, named first the Tour de Verre, later to become 53W53, next to the Museum of Modern Art in Midtown Manhattan. The supertall tower, which topped out in 2018, contains luxury apartments; three floors (2nd, 4th, and 5th) are used by MoMA, expanding its exhibition space.[33] At 1,050 feet tall, it ties with the New York Times building and the Chrysler Building, noted Curbed, as the city\u2019s sixth tallest building.[34]\nProposed\nNouvel is one of the architects involved in the designing of the new Slussen in Stockholm.[35]\nIn February 2008, Nouvel agreed to design a 45-story luxury condo tower in upscale Century City section of Los Angeles. The tower will be of modern design\u2014it is designed to maximize views of the Los Angeles Country Club from the units and is opposed by both homeowners associations in Beverly Hills for the shadows it will cast on many small homes and its next door neighbor, Beverly Hills High School.[36]\nAbandoned projects\n1989 \u2013 The Tour Sans Fins (Office/High-Rise) at La D\u00e9fense, France, was never realized. Nouvel's winning design, proposed as Europe's tallest building in 1989, was to change ground up from granite, followed by aluminum, stainless steel and finally glass\u2014\"increasingly diaphanous before disappearing into the sky\".[4]\n2003 \u2013 The Carnegie Science Center addition by Nouvel in Pittsburgh was never realized. Nouvel's winning design ended up being too expensive and Nouvel's contract was terminated by the Carnegie Science Center, citing a \"dramatic difference between the budget for the project and the estimated cost.\"[37]\nOn Tuesday 27 May 2008 Nouvel's design won the contest for the upcoming Tour Signal in La D\u00e9fense.[38]\nAwards and honors\nNouvel and the buildings which he designed have received a number of distinctions during his career, the most prestigious of which are listed below.\n\nIndividual distinctions\nHonorary degrees from the University of Buenos Aires (1983), the Royal College of Art, London (2002) and the University of Naples (2002).[5]\nHonorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects (1993) and of the Royal Institute of British Architects (1995).[5]\nIn 1997, Nouvel was named Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

It was also known for its lavish decoration and its imaginative use of both new and traditional materials, including iron, plate glass, colored tile and reinforced concrete. Notable buildings and structures of the period include the Eiffel Tower, the Grand Palais, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the Gare de Lyon, the Bon March\u00e9 department store, and the entries of the stations of the Paris Metro designed by Hector Guimard.\n\nThe architectural style of the Belle \u00c9poque often borrowed elements of historical styles, ranging from neo-Moorish Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro, to the neo-Renaissance style of the new H\u00f4tel de Ville, to the exuberant reinvention of French 17th and 18th century classicism in the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, the new building of the Sorbonne. The new railroad stations, office buildings and department stores often had classical facades which concealed resolutely modern interiors, built with iron frames, winding staircases, and large glass domes and skylights made possible by the new engineering techniques and materials of the period.\n\nThe Art Nouveau became the most famous style of the Belle \u00c9poque, particularly associated with the Paris Metro station entrances designed by Hector Guimard, and with a handful of other buildings, including Guimard's Castel B\u00e9ranger (1898) at 14 rue La Fontaine, in the 16th arrondissement, and the ceramic-sculpture covered house by architect Jules Lavirotte at 29 Avenue Rapp (7th arrondissement). [1] The enthusiasm for Art Nouveau did not last long; in 1904 the Guimard Metro entrance at Place de l'Opera it was replaced by a more classical entrance. Beginning in 1912, all the Guimard metro entrances were replaced with functional entrances without decoration.[2]\n\nThe most famous church of the period was the Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, built over the entire span of the Belle Epoque, between 1874 and 1913, but not consecrated until 1919. It was modeled after Romanesque and Byzantine cathedrals of the early Middle Ages. The first church in Paris to be constructed of reinforced concrete was Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre, at 19 rue des Abbesses at the foot of Montmartre. The architect was Anatole de Baudot, a student of Viollet-le-Duc. The nature of the revolution was not evident, because Baudot faced the concrete with brick and ceramic tiles in a colorful Art nouveau style, with stained glass windows in the same style.\n\nA new style, Art Deco, appeared at the end of the Belle \u00c9poque and succeeded Art Nouveau as the dominant architectural tradition in the 1920s. Usually built of reinforced concrete in rectangular forms, crisp straight lines, with sculptural detail applied to the outside rather than as part of the structure, it drew from classical models and stressed functionality. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es (1913), designed by Auguste Perret, was the first Paris building utilizing Art Deco. Other innovative buildings in the new style were built by Henri Sauvage, using reinforced concrete covered with ceramic tile and step-like structures to create terraces. By the 1920s, it had become the dominant style in Paris.\n\n\nContents\n1\tArchitecture of the Paris Expositions\n2\tResidential buildings\n3\tDepartment stores\n4\tOffice buildings\n5\tThe new Sorbonne\n6\tChurches and synagogues\n7\tHotels\n8\tCaf\u00e9s and restaurants\n9\tMetro station entrances\n10\tRailroad stations\n11\tBridges\n12\tThe birth of Art Deco\n13\tSee also\n14\tReferences\n14.1\tNotes and citations\n14.2\tBibliography\nArchitecture of the Paris Expositions\nThe Palace of Industry from the 1878 Exposition.

It was the largest covered space in the world when it was built.\n\nThree great international expositions were held in Paris during the Belle \u00c9poque, designed to showcase modern technologies, industries and the arts. They attracted millions of visitors from around the world, and influenced architecture far outside France.\n\nThe first, the Paris Universal Exposition of 1878, occupied the Champ-de-Mars, the hill of Chaillot on the other side of the Seine, and the esplanade of the Invalides. The central building, the Palais de Trocadero, was constructed in a picturesque neo-Moorish or neo-Byzantine style by architect Gabriel Davioud, whose other notable works, built for Napoleon III, included the two theaters on the Place du Chatelet and the Fontaine Saint-Michel. The palace was used in all three Expositions of the Belle \u00c9poque, but was finally demolished in 1936 to make room for the modern Palace of Chaillot.\n\nThe Paris Universal Exposition of 1889, celebrating the centenary of the French Revolution, was much larger than the 1878 Exposition, and gave Paris two revolutionary new structures; The Eiffel Tower was the tallest structure in the world, and became the symbol of the Exposition. The tower brought lasting fame to its constructor, Gustave Eiffel. The architects of the tower, including Stephen Sauvestre, who designed the graceful curving arches of the base, the glass observation platform on the second level and the cupola at the top, remain nearly unknown.[3]\n\nAn equally significant building constructed for the fair was the Galerie des machines, designed by architect Ferdinand Dutert and engineer Victor Contamin. It was located at the opposite end of Champ-de-Mars from the Eiffel Tower. It was reused at the exposition of 1900 and then destroyed in 1910. At 111 meters, the Galerie (or \"Machinery Hall\") spanned the longest interior space in the world at the time, using a system of hinged arches (like a series of bridge spans placed not end-to-end but parallel) made of iron.[4] It was used again in the 1900 Exposition. When the 1900 Exposition ended, the French government offered to move the structure to the edge of Paris, but the city government chose to demolish it in order to resell the building materials. It was torn down in 1909.[5]\n\nThe Grand Palais (1900) had a neoclassical facade concealing a cathedral-like glass and iron exhibit hall.\nThe Grand Palais (1900) had a neoclassical facade concealing a cathedral-like glass and iron exhibit hall.\n\n \nThe interior of the Grand Palais was an enormous gallery of sculpture during the 1900 Exposition\nThe interior of the Grand Palais was an enormous gallery of sculpture during the 1900 Exposition\n\n \nThe stairway of honor of the Grand Palais, built of copper\nThe stairway of honor of the Grand Palais, built of copper\n\nThe 1900 Exposition was the largest and most successful of them all, occupying most of the space along the Seine from the Champs-de-Mars and Trocadero to the Place de la Concorde. The Grand Palais, the largest exhibition hall, was designed by architect Henri Deglane, assisted by Albert Louvet. Deglane had been an assistant to Dufert, the builder of the Palace of Machines. The new building contained an enormous gallery, whose arches converged to create a monumental glass dome. Though its visible iron framework made it appear very revolutionary and modern, much of its iron work purely decorative; the gothic iron columns which seemed to support the dome did not carry any weight; the weight was actually distributed to reinforced columns hidden behind the balconies. The facade was massive and neoclassical, with towering rows of columns supporting two sculptural ensembles. It served both to give a strong vertical element to balance the great width of the building, and to conceal the glass and steel structure behind. It was also designed to be in harmony with the historic buildings nearby, including the buildings around the Place de la Concorde and the 17th century church of Les Invalides on the other side of the Seine. The facade was greatly admired and widely imitated; a similar facade was given to the New York Public Library in 1911.\n\nThe most prominent architectural feature inside the Grand Palais was the Grand Stairway of Honor, which overlooked the main floor, which at the 1900 Exposition contained an exhibition of monumental sculpture. It was perfectly classical in style. It was originally intended to be built of stone. Deglane and Louvet built a model of plaster and stucco on a metal frame, and then decided, to make it harmonious with the rest of the interior, to make it completely out of copper, highly ornamental and very expensive. Using iron in place of stone traditionally reduced building costs, but in the case of the Grand Palais, because of the enormous amounts of iron used, it actually increased the cost. The construction of the Grand Palais used 9,507 tons of metal, compared with 7,300 tons for the Eiffel Tower. [6]\n\nThe grand entrance of the Petit Palais, and its impressive colonnade\nThe grand entrance of the Petit Palais, and its impressive colonnade\n\n \nOne of the reinforced concrete stairways of the Petit Palais\nOne of the reinforced concrete stairways of the Petit Palais\n\n \nThe use of reinforced concrete and large windows and skylights gave the interior of the Petit Palais an abundance of light and space\nThe use of reinforced concrete and large windows and skylights gave the interior of the Petit Palais an abundance of light and space\n\nThe Petit Palais, designed by Charles Giraud, was directly across from the Grand Palais, and had a similar monumental entrance (both entrances were designed by Giraud). Both buildings also had rows of massive columns, which served as a powerful vertical element to balance the great width of the buildings, and also concealed the modern iron framework behind. However, the most original feature of the Petit Palais was the interior; Girault eliminated the traditional walls and spaces and made full use of reinforced concrete to create majestic winding staircases and wide entry ways, built enormous skylights and windows that provided abundant light, and turned the interior into a single unified space.

Haussmann had required that apartment buildings have the same height, and that facades have the same general design and color of stone. In 1898, to try to bring more variety to the appearance of the boulevards, the City of Paris sponsored a competition for the best new apartment building facade. One of the first winners in 1898 was the thirty-one year old architect Hector Guimard (1867\u20131942). Guimard's building, built between 1895 and 1898, was called the Castel Beranger, and was located at 14 rue de la Fontaine in the 16th arrondissement. It contained thirty-six apartments, and each one was different architecturally. Guimard thought out and designed every aspect of the building himself, down to the door-knobs. He introduced an abundance neo-Gothic decorative elements, made of wrought iron or sculpted in stone, which gave it a personality different from any other Paris building. Guimard was also an expert at the new art of public relations, and he persuaded critics and the public that the new building heralded a revolution in architecture. Before long, based on his work and his publicity, he became the most famous of Paris Belle \u00c9poque architects. [8]\n\nIn 1901, the facade competition was won by another remarkable architect, Jules Lavirotte (1864\u20131924), for an apartment building whose facade featured ceramic decoration by Alexandre Bigot, a chemistry professor who became interested in ceramics at the Chinese exhibition at the 1889 International Exposition, and who started his own firm to make ceramic sculpture and decoration. The Lavirotte Building, located at 29 Avenue Rapp in the 7th arrondissement, became its most prominent advertisement. The Lavirotte Building was more a piece of sculpture than a traditional building. Unlike other Paris buildings, whose decoration was usually modeled a particular period or style, the Lavirotte Building, like the opera house of Charles Garnier, was unique; there was nothing else in Paris like it. The front entrance was surrounded by ceramic sculpture, and upper floors were entirely covered with ceramic tile and decoration. The building also featured a novel construction feature; the walls were built of hollow bricks; iron rods were inserted inside, and the bricks were filled with cement. For the exterior decoration, Lavirotte commissioned a team of sculptors and craftsmen. [9]\n\n\nThe Hotel de Choudens, (1901), a neo-Renaissance mansion by Charles Girault, designer of the Petit Palais.\nThe H\u00f4tel Guadet (1913)\nThe house of architect Paul Guadet (1913)\nIn 1904, the architect Auguste Perret used reinforced concrete to create a revolutionary new building at 25 bis on Rue Franklin in the 16th arrondissement. Reinforced concrete had been used before in Paris, usually to imitate stone. Perret was among the first to take full advantage of the new architectural forms it could make. The building was on a small site, but offered an exceptional view of Paris. To maximize the view, Perret built the house with large windows framed with ceramic decorative plaques made by Alexandre Bigot, mounted on reinforced concrete, so that the facade of the building was almost entirely windows. The plaques were of a neutral color, to give the appearance of stone. By adding an exc\u00e8dre on the facade, he was able to create five apartments on each floor, each with the view, whereas a flat traditional facade would have had only four.\n\nNear the end of the Belle \u00c9poque, Hector Guimard changed his style radically from what it had been when he built Castel B\u00e9ranger in 1899. Between 1909 and 1913 he built his own house, the H\u00f4tel Guimard, on Avenue Mozart in the 16th arrondissement. He abandoned the colors and decorations of the earlier style, and replaced with a building made masonry and stone which seemed to have been sculpted by nature. Hector had been influenced by a meeting when he was young with the Belgian art nouveau architect Victor Horta, who told him that the only aspect of nature that an architect should imitate was the curve of the stems of flowers and plants. Guimard had followed Horta's advice in the decor of Castel Beranger; in the H\u00f4tel Guimard he followed this advice in the wrought-iron railings, the door and window frames and curves of the building itself, which seemed to be a living thing. [10]\n\nThe architect Paul Guadet (1873\u20131931) was another pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete. He was the architect of several telephone exchanges for the Ministry of the Post Office, remarkable for their clean lines and modern appearance. The Post Office was his employer from 1912 until his death. The facade of his own house, at 95 boulevard Murat in the 16th arrondissement, is remarkably modern; it is almost all windows, framed by concrete columns, discreetly decorated with colored ceramic tiles.\n\nOn the streets of Paris, an elegant neo-classicism coexisted comfortably with the new styles. The Hotel Camondo. now the Mus\u00e9e Nissim de Camondo), at 63 Rue Monceau in the 8th arrondissement, was designed by Ren\u00e9 Sergent (1865\u20131927). He was a graduate of the \u00c9cole special d'architecture, a school founded in opposition to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and to the Art Nouveau movement, dedicated to preserving the spirit of Viollet-le-Duc, and training architects who were skilled in both the arts and engineering. It was completed in 1911. The exterior was pure Louis XVI, inspired by the Petit Trianon and borrowing many architectural details from that building. The interior had the most modern technology available, including electric lighting and a very early use of indirect lighting. [11]\n\nThe H\u00f4tel de Choudens, at 21 Rue Blanche in the 9th arrondissement, was another neoclassical house, designed by Charles Girault (1851\u20131932), who had won the Prix de Rome and who had won fame designing the Petit Palais for the 1900 Exposition. It was built for Paul de Choudens, a writer of librettos and musical editor. In addition to the traditional reception rooms, the ground floor included a room designed for musical auditions. It was inspired largely by the houses of the Italian Renaissance, but Girault added modern touches in the curving windows, the floral wrought-iron decoration, and a series of terraces in the rear facing the garden.\n\nDepartment stores\nInterior of the Bon March\u00e9 department store (1875)\nInterior of the Bon March\u00e9 department store (1875)\n\n \nThe Grand Bazar on the Rue de Rennes on its opening day (1906)\nThe Grand Bazar on the Rue de Rennes on its opening day (1906)\n\n \nA floral Art Nouveau sign by artist Eug\u00e8ne Grasset for the facade of La Samaritaine (1903\u20131907)\nA floral Art Nouveau sign by artist Eug\u00e8ne Grasset for the facade of La Samaritaine (1903\u20131907)\n\n \nThe art-nouveau cupola of Galeries Lafayette (1912) provides natural light to the levels around the courtyard below.\nThe art-nouveau cupola of Galeries Lafayette (1912) provides natural light to the levels around the courtyard below.\n\nThe modern department store was born in Paris in 1852, shortly before the Belle \u00c9poque, when Aristide Boucicaut enlarged a medium-sized variety store called Au Bon March\u00e9, using innovative new means of marketing and pricing, including a mail order catalog and seasonal sales. When Boucicaut took charge of the store in 1852, it had an income of 500,000 francs and twelve employees. Twenty years later it had 1,825 employees and an income of more than 20 million francs. In 1869 Boucicault began constructing a much larger store, with an iron frame, a central courtyard covered with a glass skylight, on the rue de S\u00e8vres. The architect was Louis Boileau, who received some assistance from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel. After more enlargements and modifications, the building was finished in 1887, and became the prototype for other department stores in Paris and around the world.[12]\n\nOther department stores appeared to rival Au Bon March\u00e9: au Louvre in 1865; the Bazar de l'Hotel de Ville (BHV) in 1866, Au Printemps in 1865; La Samaritaine in 1870, and Galeries Lafayette in 1895. Between 1903 and 1907 the architect Frantz Jourdain created the interior and facades of the new building of La Samaritaine. He commissioned the decorative artist Eug\u00e8ne Grasset to create the huge inscription of the name of the store, against a floral background. He used an abundance of enameled tiles and a brightly colored interior and exterior, using yellow and orange panels to contrast with the vertical blue columns, which ended in a Gothic-inspired top story. The rectangular metal framework of the exterior was entirely covered and brightened with floral designs. The original 1907 structure had two towers with domes and spires, like a Chateau of the Loire; these were demolished when the store was enlarged toward the Seine in the 1920s. In the 1930s the architect Henri Sauvage updated the facade and replaced many Art Nouveau features with art deco elements. [13]\n\nGas lighting and early electric lighting presented serious dangers of fire for early department stores; architects of the new stores used huge ornamental glass skylights whenever possible to fill the stores with natural light, and designed the balconies around the central courts to provide the maximum of light to each section. The Galeries Lafayette store on Boulevard Haussmann, finished in 1912, combined skylights over courtyards with balconies with undulating railings, which gave the interiors the rich roccoco effect of a baroque palace. Before the store was enlarged and modernized, it had several vertical great halls filled with light from richly decorated glass cupolas.

The first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building, a ten-story building with a steel frame. was built in Chicago in 1893\u201394 by Louis Sullivan. Despite these developments in America, Paris architects and clients showed little interest in building tall office buildings. Paris was already the most densely populated city in Europe, it was already the banking and financial capital of the continent, and moreover, as of 1889 it had the tallest structure in the world, the Eiffel Tower. Beside the Eiffel Tower, The skyline of Paris presented the Arc de Triomphe, the dome of the Basilca of Sacre Coeur, the Arc de Triomphe, and numerous church domes, towers and spires. While some Paris architects visited Chicago to see what has happening, no clients wanted to change the familiar skyline of Paris. [15]\n\nThe new office buildings of the Belle \u00c9poque often made use of steel, plate glass, elevators and other new architectural technologies, but they were hidden inside sober neoclassical stone facades, and the buildings matched the height of the other buildings on Haussmann's boulevards. The Saint-Gobain glass company built a new headquarters on Place des Saussaies in the 8th arrondissement in the 1890s. Since the firm had been founded under Louis XIV in 1665, the facade of the building, designed by architect Paul No\u00ebl, was perfectly modern on the inside, but had architectural touches from the earlier century; colossal columns, a square dome, and beautifully detailed sculptural ornament.\n\nDramatic glass domes became a common feature of Belle \u00c9poque commercial and office buildings in Paris; they provided abundant light when gaslight was a common fire hazard and electric lights were primitive. They followed the example of the central book storeroom of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale by Henri Labrouste in 1863 and the skylight of Bon March\u00e9 department store by Louis-Charles Boileau in 1874. The architect Jacques Hermant (1855\u20131930) had a purely classical training; he won the Prix de Rome from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in 1880 but he was also fascinated by modern ideas. in 1880 had traveled to Chicago to see the new office buildings there, and he designed an innovative iron frame for the Hall of Civil Engineering at the Exposition of 1900. Between 1905 and 1911, he built the spectacular glass dome of the headquarters of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale at 29 Boulevard Haussmann. [16]\n\nThe headquarters of the bank Cr\u00e9dit lyonnais, built in 1883 on the boulevard des Italiens in 1883 by William Bouwens Van der Boijen, was classical on the outside, but inside one of the most modern buildings of its time, using an iron frame and glass skylight to provide ample light to large hall where the title deeds were held. In 1907 the building was updated with a new entrance at 15 rue du Quatre-Septembre, designed by Victor Laloux, who also designed the Gare d'Orsay, now the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay The new entrance featured a striking rotunda with a glass dome over a floor of glass bricks, which allowed the daylight to illuminate the level below, and the three other levels below. The entrance was badly damaged by a fire in 1996; the rotunda was restored, but the only a few elements still remain of the titles hall.[17]\n\nThe new Sorbonne\nOne of the two stairways to the Grand Amphitheater of the Sorbonne\nOne of the two stairways to the Grand Amphitheater of the Sorbonne\n\n \nPanorama of the Grand Amphitheater, decorated with murals of the history of the university.\nPanorama of the Grand Amphitheater, decorated with murals of the history of the university.\n\n \nThe Salle Saint-Jacques, the reading room of the Sorbonne library (1897)\nThe Salle Saint-Jacques, the reading room of the Sorbonne library (1897)\n\nOne of the most prestigious building projects of the Belle \u00c9poque was the reconstruction of a new building for the Sorbonne, replacing the crumbling and overcrowded buildings of the old university, while preserving the spirit and tradition of the architecture of the 17th century. The competition in 1882 was won by a little-known architect, Henri-Paul N\u00e9not, who was only twenty-nine years old. He was a graduate of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, and had worked for various architects, including Charles Garnier. The principal feature of the building is the Grand Amphitheater, at 47 rue des \u00c9coles. N\u00e9not placed the most striking features of the building in the interior, in the vestibule with its great arches and its two symmetrical stairways leading to the balconies and to the grand hall of the Council of the University, placed under a cupola completely open up to the second floor. He gave great attention to the secondary spaces, not just the main rooms, and to the different perspectives created as visitors climbed the stairways. A starkly modern skylight fills the amphitheater with light. The openness of the interior architecture also illuminates and highlights the murals which illustrate the history of the university.\n\nThe first part of the project was carried out in the 1880s. The second part, in the 1890s, was creating new facades and an arcade around the great courtyard at 17 rue de la Sorbonne, which looked out on the chapel. N\u00e9not preserved some of the motifs of the old buildings, and a few original architectural features, such as the large sundial which decorated the facade central building on the courtyard. The facades were simplified and given a greater clarity and harmony, while preserving the essential spirit of the 17th century architecture.[18] The Salle Saint-Jacques, the reading room of the Sorbonne library, with its arched ceiling and walls decorated in the pure Beaux-arts style, was completed in 1897.[19]\n\nChurches and synagogues\nThe Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, designed by Paul Abadie, built between 1874 and 1914\nThe Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, designed by Paul Abadie, built between 1874 and 1914\n\n \nThe Eglise Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre, by Anatole de Baudot (1894)\nThe Eglise Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre, by Anatole de Baudot (1894)\n\n \nInterior of the \u00c9glise Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre\nInterior of the \u00c9glise Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre\n\n \nThe church of Notre-Dame-du-Travail, built for the construction workers of the 1900 Exposition (1897\u20131902)\nThe church of Notre-Dame-du-Travail, built for the construction workers of the 1900 Exposition (1897\u20131902)\n\n \nExterior of the rue Pav\u00e9e Synagogue, by Hector Guimard (1913)\nExterior of the rue Pav\u00e9e Synagogue, by Hector Guimard (1913)\n\n \nInterior of the Synagogue on Rue Pav\u00e9e, with its discreet Art Nouveau detail\nInterior of the Synagogue on Rue Pav\u00e9e, with its discreet Art Nouveau detail\n\nMost of the churches in the early period of the Belle \u00c9poque were constructed in an eclectic or historical style; the most prominent example was the Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur on Montmartre, designed by Paul Abadie. His project was chosen by the archbishop after a competition of seventy-eight different projects. Abedie was an expert on romanesque, medieval and Byzantine architecture, and in historical restoration; he had worked with Viollet-le-Duc on the restoration of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in the 1840s. His design was a combination of neo-Romanesque and neo-Byzantine styles, similar to the domes of the 12th century Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Front in Perigueux, which Abadie had helped restore, and which he modified considerably in the restoration. The construction of the Basilica lasted from 1874 until 1914, thanks in part to problems in constructing on Montmartre, which was riddled by tunnels used for mining gypsum, used to make plaster for Paris buildings. Abadie died in 1884, well before the work was finished. The consecration of the church was delayed by the First World War, and did not take place until 1919. [20]\n\nLater in the period, at the end of the 20th century, some architects tried to develop a new forms and a new aesthetic, using modern materials. The best example was the \u00c9glise Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre, begun in 1894 by architect Anatole de Baudot. Baudot was an expert in medieval architecture, and was a pupil of Viollet-le-Duc. He was professor at the \u00c9cole de Chaillot, which trained the architects in the restoration of historical monuments, as well as professor of medieval architecture at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. In his project for the new church, he combined the gothic with the Art Nouveau. He commissioned some of the major artists of the Art Nouveau, including ceramics artist Alexandre Bigot, ironwork craftsman \u00c9mile Robert, and sculptor Pierre Roche. It was the first church in Paris to be built of reinforced concrete, and Some features, particularly the facades of the sides, were highly original. The result was a curious combination of the gothic and modernism. The leading figure of modernist architecture in the 1920s, Corbusier, was particularly outraged by the church and described it as \"hideous\".[21]\n\nAnother original design was that of the \u00c9glise-de-Notre-Dame-du-Travail in the 14th arrondissement, by architect Jules Astruc, built between 1897 and 1902. It replaced a smaller church in the parish, and was designed for the large numbers of construction workers who had come to Paris to work on the 1900 Exposition and who settled in the neighborhood. While the exterior of the church is a simple and unadorned Romanesque style, the interior the iron framework was openly and dramatically on display.[22]\n\nIn 1913 Hector Guimard designed the Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue at 10 rue de Pave\u00e9 in the Marais neighborhood. It was built for the Union of Orthodox Jews, as a place of worship for the large number of Jewish refugees coming from Russia and eastern Europe at the turn of the century. Like his other late art nouveau buildings, it had very little ornament on the outside; its originality was expressed in the undulations of its vertical lines. The interior was slightly more decorative, with all the luminaries, brackets, iron railings and vegetal decoration designed by Guimard himself. On the eve of Yom Kippur in 1941, during the German occupation, it was dynamited, along with six other Paris Mosques, badly damaging the facade, but was restored. The new facade, particularly the gable over the entrance, is slightly more curved and ornate than the original.

Like the residential building designed by Lavirotte, the reinforced concrete facade is almost completely covered with decoration made by the ceramics studio of Alexandre Bigot. It won the municipal competition for best facade in 1905.\n\nThe most prominent hotel built in the Art Nouveau style is the Hotel Lutetia, built in 1910 at 45 Boulevard Raspail. It was constructed by the owners of the Le Bon March\u00e9 department store, on the other side of Square Boucicault. It was originally built by the owners of the department store as a place to stay for the wealthy customers coming from out of town. The architect was Louis-Charles Boileau, who also enlarged the department store. The facade remains Art Nouveau, but the interior was remodeled later to Art Deco.\n\nCaf\u00e9s and restaurants\nAn Art Nouveau private dining room by Henri Sauvage from the Caf\u00e9 de Paris (1899), now in the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet\nAn Art Nouveau private dining room by Henri Sauvage from the Caf\u00e9 de Paris (1899), now in the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet\n\n \nTrain Bleu Restaurant in the Gare de Lyon (1902).

Painting by Alexandre Gervex (1909).\n\nThe architecture and decor of Paris restaurants closely followed the styles of the day. The most characteristic restaurant of the Belle \u00c9poque style still in existence is the Train Bleu restaurant, designed by Marius Toudoire as the station buffet when it opened in 1902. The lavishly decorated interior is in the style of the 1900 Exposition, the event for which the station was built. The light coming through the large arched windows out the facade on one side, and onto the platform from which trains depart on the other.\n\nThe classic Art Nouveau style was used by architect Henri Sauvage in 1899 when he designed an intimate private dining room for the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, The furnishings were designed in forms imitating nature, plants and flowers. The Caf\u00e9 was demolished in 1950, and nothing remains but these furnishings, which are now on display in the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet.\n\nThe most classical and at the same time the most original restaurant design of the period belonged to the Restaurant of the Pr\u00e9 Catalan, located in the Pr\u00e9 Catalan gardens of the Bois de Boulogne. The building, designed by Guillaume Tronchet in 1905. was in the style of the Petit Trianon of Louis XVI, with one major exception; the walls were almost entirely of large sheets of plate glass, from the floor to the ceiling, in the style of the new Paris department stores. The diners inside could look out at the gardens, while those outside could watch the diners within. A 1909 painting of the restaurant by Henri Gervex, Un soir\u00e9e au Pr\u00e9-Catalan, captured the modern spirit of the restaurant. The diners inside the restaurant in the painting include the aviation pioneer Santos-Dumont and the Marquis de Dion, one of the first automobile constructors. [24]\n\nMetro station entrances\n\nThe edicule of the Metro at Place de la Bastille, demolished in 1962.\n\nthe Metro edicule at Porte Dauphine is the only one still in its original place.\nIn 1899 the company building the new Paris Metro system, the Compagnie du chemin de fer m\u00e9tropolitain de Paris (CMP), held a competition for the design of the new edicules, or station entrances, to be built around the city. The rules of the competition required that the new edicules \"should not make ugly or impede the public way around the stations; on the contrary, they should amuse the eye and decorate the sidewalks.\"[25] Guimard, considered the most audacious architect of the period, won the competition. The unique style of his stations made them easily recognizable from a distance, one of the important requirements of the competition. He designed a whole series of different variations, ranging from small and simple railing of a stairway to a large pavilion for the Place de la Bastille. Guimard's entrances, with their color, material and form, were in harmony with the stone buildings of the Paris streets, and even, with their vegetal curves, fit well with trees and gardens. They were not used in certain locations, such as place de l'Opera, where they would have looked out of place next to the enormous monuments. The design and construction of the entrances was done by another architect, Joseph Cassien-Bernard (1848\u20131926).\n\nThe entrances were admired at first, but tastes changed, and in 1925 the entrance at the Place de la Concorde was demolished and replaced with a simpler, classical entrance. Gradually, almost all of the Guimard entrances were replaced. Today, there are only three original edicules. The edicule at Porte Dauphine is the only one still in its original place; the edicule at Abbesses was at the Hotel de Ville until 1974; and the edicule at Place du Ch\u00e2telet was recreated in 2000 to celebrate the centenary of the Metro system.\n\nRailroad stations\nGare de Lyon, by architect Marius Toudoire (1895\u20131902).\nGare de Lyon, by architect Marius Toudoire (1895\u20131902).\n\n \nThe clock of the Gare d'Orsay, by Victor Laloux\nThe clock of the Gare d'Orsay, by Victor Laloux\n\n \nInterior of the Gare d'Orsay (now the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay) in about 1900.\nInterior of the Gare d'Orsay (now the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay) in about 1900.\n\nThe main railroad stations of Paris predated the Belle \u00c9poque, but they were enlarged and lavishly decorated to impress the visitors to the Expositions of 1889 and 1900. The Gare Saint-Lazare featured a grand shelter for the trains forty meters high, built between 1851 and 1853 by Eug\u00e8ne Flachat, and memorably captured in the impressionist paintings of Claude Monet in 1877. It was enlarged and redecorated for the 1889 Exposition by Juste Lisch, who also designed the neighboring Hotel Terminus. The Gare du Nord, by architects Reynaud and Jacques Ignace Hittorff, was finished in 1866, but expanded in 1889 for the 1900 Exposition. The Gare de l'Est, first built between 1847 and 1850, was tripled in size between 1895 and 1899 to welcome Exposition visitors. The Gare Montparnasse, first built in 1840 on Avenue du Maine for the Paris-Versailles line, was moved to its present location between 1848 and 1852, and then enlarged and redecorated between 1898 and 1900 for the 1900 Exposition.\n\nThe Gare de Lyon, originally built for the line Paris-Monterau in 1847, was completely rebuilt between 1895 and 1902 by architect Marius Toudoire (1852\u20131922) and the engineering firm of Denis, Carthault and Bouvard. Unlike the earlier stations, which had traditional neoclassical facades attached to the modern structure of the train shed. Toudoire chose to give the Gare de Lyon a facade different from other public buildings; it had a series of monumental arches with doorways opening to arcades within the station. The spaces between the arches were decorated with sculpture. Above that level was an even more unusual element; a strong horizontal band of windows. The tower with an enormous clock was another unusual feature, unlike any other train station or historical model in the city.[26] The interior features included a buffet later named the Train Bleu, in the most lavish Belle \u00c9poque style.[27]\n\nThe Gare d'Austerlitz, or Gare d'Orleans, was inaugurated in 1843 and enlarged between 1846 and 1852. In 1900 the same company decided to build a new station, the Gare d'Orsay, closer to the center of the city and to the Exposition. It was the first station designed to accommodate electric trains, and it was intended to contain a hotel as well as a train station; the hotel was placed where the museum entrance is today. The original design for the station called for a Renaissance style facade similar to that of Haussmann's buildings on the boulevards. The City of Paris wanted something more monumental to match the grandeur of the Louvre across the Seine, but also wanted it to clearly express its function as a train station. The city required that a competition be held, which was won by Victor Laloux. His winning design included a feature similar to the Gare de Lyon; he opened the side of the station facing the Seine with very high arches filled with windows, and the facade above the windows was decorated with sculptures and emblems. The huge clock became an integral part of the facade. [28] The new station was inaugurated on July 4, 1900, just in time for the Exposition. As a train station it was not a commercial success, and was planned for demolition in 1971, but was saved and between 1980 and 1986, it was transformed into a museum of 19th century French art, the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.[29]\n\nBridges\nThe Pont Alexandre-III (1896\u20131900)\nThe Pont Alexandre-III (1896\u20131900)\n\n \nThe Viaduc d'Austerlitz, built for Paris Metro by Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9 (1903\u20131904)\nThe Viaduc d'Austerlitz, built for Paris Metro by Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9 (1903\u20131904)\n\n \nThe Pont de Bir-Hakeim by Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9 (1905)\nThe Pont de Bir-Hakeim by Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9 (1905)\n\nEight new bridges were built across the Seine between 1876 and 1905; the Pont Sully, (1876), to the Ile-Saint-Louis, replacing two footbridges from 1836; the Pont de Tolbiac (1882); the Pont Mirabeau in 1895; the Pont Alexandre-III (1900), built for the 1900 Exposition; the Pont de Grenelle-Passy (1900) for the railroad; the Passerelle Debilly, a footbridge connecting sites of the 1900 Exposition on the two banks; the Pont de Bir-Hakeim (1905), built which carried both pedestrians and a metro line; and the Viaduc d'Austerlitz, used by the Metro.[30]\n\nThe most elegant and famous of the Belle \u00c9poque bridges is the Pont Alexandre-III, designed by architects Joseph Cassien-Bernard and Gaston Cousin, and engineers Jean R\u00e9sal and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e d'Alby. It was largely decorative, designed to connect the Grand Palais and Petit Palais of the Exposition on the right bank with the parts of the Exposition the left bank. The first stone was laid by Nicholas II of Russia, the future Czar, in October 1896. The bridge combined the modern engineering of a single iron span bridge 107 meters long with classical beaux-arts architecture. The counterweights supporting the bridge are four massive masonry columns, seventeen meters high, which serve as the bases for four works of beaux-arts sculpture, representing the four \"Fames\"; the Sciences, the Arts, Commerce, and Industry. In the center, the sides of the bridge are decorated with two groups of river nymphs; the Nymphs of the Seine on one side, the Nymphs of the Neva on the other. A similar bridge, the Trinity Bridge, designed by Gustave Eiffel, was built over the Neva River in the Russian Capital, St. Petersburg, beginning in 1897.[31]\n\nThe Viaduc d'Austerlitz was an even greater engineering challenge; It was built in 1903\u20131904 to carry Line 5 of the Paris Metro over the Seine. Because of the nature of the river, it had to be single span, 140 meters long; it was the longest bridge in Paris until 1996, when the Pont Charles-de-Gaulle was built. The architect was Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9, the chief of public works of Paris, whose other works included the Greenhouses of Auteuil. As chief of historical monuments of France, he was also responsible for the restoration of the Roman theater at Orange and the Roman amphitheater of Arles. Formig\u00e9 faced the task of designing a massive bridge which would fit with the monumental buildings along the Seine. He wanted to follow the advice given by Charles Garnier, architect of the Paris Opera, in 1886: \"Paris should not be transformed into a factory; it should remain a museum.\" The bridge combined a graceful double arc anchored to four classical buttresses, and richly decorated with iron and stone sculptural details, to harmonize with the other monuments in the center of the city. [32]\n\nHis other new bridge, originally the Pont de Passy, now called the Pont de Bir-Hakeim, carries pedestrians and traffic on one level, and a Metro line, supported by slender iron pillars. It also artfully combined an original functional structure with sculpture and decoration. including groups of sculpture where the iron arches met the piers of the bridge, [32]\n\nThe birth of Art Deco\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the Art deco style, by Auguste Perret (1911\u20131912)\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the Art deco style, by Auguste Perret (1911\u20131912)\n\n \nLobby decor of Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, with paintings by Maurice Denis\nLobby decor of Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, with paintings by Maurice Denis\n\n \nApartment house at 26 Rue Vavin (6th arrondissement) by Henri Sauvage ((1913)\nApartment house at 26 Rue Vavin (6th arrondissement) by Henri Sauvage ((1913)\n\nAt the end of the Belle \u00c9poque, in about 1910, a new style emerged in Paris, Art Deco largely in reaction to the Art Nouveau. The first major architects to use the style were August Perret (1874\u20131954), and Henri Sauvage (1873\u20131932). The main principles of the stye were functionality, classicism and architectural coherence. The curved lines and vegetal patterns of art nouveau gave way to the straight line, simple and precise, and rectangles within rectangles. The preferred building material was reinforced concrete. The decoration was no longer part of the structure itself, as in the Art Nouveau; it was attached to the structure, often in sculpted bas-reliefs, as it was in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. [33]\n\nThe first prominent Paris building in the style was the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, (1911\u20131912) by Auguste Perret, with sculptural decoration by Antoine Bourdelle. The original project was designed by Henri Fivaz. then by Roger Bouvard, and was intended to be in the gardens of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, but a change in the regulations of the gardens caused the theater to be moved to 13\u201315 avenue Montaigne. The owner, Gabriel Astruc, then commissioned the Belgian art-nouveau architect, Henry Van de Velde, painter Maurice Denis and sculptor Antoine Bourdelle. Auguste Perret was added to the project due to his expertise in the new material, reinforced concrete. Van de Velde and Perret were unable to degree on a design, resulting in the withdrawal of Van de Velde. The final basic design was that of Van de Velde, but was transformed by Perret into an entirely new style. The large lobby was particularly remarkable for the way that the form followed the function; The concrete beams of the ceiling and the supporting columns were immediately visible. It was both perfectly classical and surprisingly modern. The modern architectural critic Gilles Plum wrote, \"the form seemed the pure consequence of the construction technique; that was the gothic ideal according to Viollet-le-Duc.\" }. The interior was decorated by a remarkable collection of artists; besides Maurice Denis and Bourdelle, they included \u00c9douard Vuillard and Ker-Xavier Roussel, inspired by classical and mythological themes, as well as by the music of Debussy. [34]\n\nAnother architect at the end of the Belle Epoque whose work heralded the new art deco style was Henri Sauvage. In 1913 he constructed an apartment block at 26 rue Vavin in the 6th arrondissement, for a group of artists and decorators. The exterior was simple and geometric, completely covered with ceramic tiles. the most unusual feature of the buildings were the gradins; the upper floors were arranged like a stairway, which allowed residents on these floors to have terraces and gardens. The only decoration was the iron railings and geometric patterns created by mixing a few black tiles with the white tiles. .[35]\n\nSee also\nConcours de fa\u00e7ades de la ville de Paris\nReferences\nNotes and citations\n Sarmant 2012, p. 202.\n Marchand 1993, p. 169.\n Plum 2014, p. 5.\n Stamper, John, Studies in the History of Civil Engineering (2000), Volume 1.\n Plum 2014, p. 14.\n Plum 2014, p. 22.\n Plum 2014, p. 115.\n Lahor 2007, p. 139.\n Plum 2014, p. 44.\n Plum 2014, p. 88.\n Plum 2014, p. 86.\n Naissance des grands magasins : le Bon March\u00e9 (by Jacques Marseille, in French, on the official site of the Ministry of Culture of France\n Plum 2014, p. 20.\n Plum 2014, p. 28.\n Plum 2014, pp. 34\u201335.\n Plum 2014, p. 24.\n Plum 2014, p. 26.\n Plum 2014, pp. 100\u2013103.\n \"La biblioth\u00e8que de la nouvelle Sorbonne (1897 a now jours)\" (in French).
